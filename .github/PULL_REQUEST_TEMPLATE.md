## Variables

Help us support a “Write once, publish everywhere” single source of truth. If you see a line that looks like:

![Example shortcode](/git/ExampleShortcode.png "Example shortcode")

You’ve found a [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) that we include in multiple documents.

You’ll find the content of the shortcode in the following directory:

https://github.com/cobalthq/cobalt-product-public-docs/tree/main/layouts/shortcodes

That shortcode has the same base name as what you see in the PR, such as `asset-categories.html`.
