## Who We Are

Cobalt is a fast-growing startup that is redefining pentesting and making cybersecurity easier and more accessible. Our Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform, coupled with an exclusive global community of testers, delivers the real-time insights you need to remediate risk quickly and innovate securely. We have Scandinavian roots, an American base and a global outlook. Our remote-first team is characterized by a fun, fast-paced and collaborative culture based on individual responsibility and ownership.

## Description

Today, Cobalt helps secure hundreds of leading B2B companies (GoDaddy, HubSpot, Pendo, Solarisbank, etc.) by connecting them with on-demand pentesting experts. Seven years and 20K penetration tests later, our technology has been battle tested by thousands of users.

What's next? Cobalt is growing its Product Documentation team to help solidify our status as a world-class security platform. As a (Senior) Technical Writer, you'll help our customers understand how to best use Cobalt software, with your skills and experience in:

- Security
- UI Text
- APIs
- Docs-as-code

Typical security documentation is dense. If you can create content for complex topics at a Flesch-Kincaid grade level 10 (or below!), we want to talk to you. If you enjoy making an impact, we as the Cobalt Product team want to hear from you.

- Enhance the text in our UI to optimize our system usability
- Set up our documentation to maximize its use as a Single Source of Truth
- Write/Rewrite content to maximize readability
- Collaborate in a fast-paced startup environment, making an impact as we aim to build the best Pentesting-as-a-Service (PtaaS) platform.
