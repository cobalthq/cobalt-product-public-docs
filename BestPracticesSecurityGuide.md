## Best Practices for Security

We're starting a [Best Practices for Security](./content/en/BestPractices/_index.md) guide. In
this guide, we feature content from our [Cobalt Core](https://cobalt.io/our-pentesters) pentesters.

We'll work towards content that's more readable than most security documentation. We want
content that's readable by people at US Grade Level 10, using criteria developed
for the US Navy ([Flesch-Kincaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)).

<!-- While I don't like to cite Wikipedia, all other sources I've found sell specific products -->

We're focusing our efforts on the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) from 2021.

To help our pentesters, we've set up a grammar linter known as
[Vale](https://errata.ai/vale-server/), based on the [Google Developer Style
Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/), modified for Cobalt requirements. For
installation instructions, see our [Grammar Linter](./GrammarLinter.md) page.
