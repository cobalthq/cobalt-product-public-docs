If a potential attacker achieves this goal, an organization could face:

- Leaks of sensitive or confidential information from the organization's network. The exfiltration of trade secrets or internal communication data could damage the affected organization. Such leaks could include:
  - Personnel records
  - Payment data
  - Other financial records
- Attackers who use the mail gateway or website as the source of spam email. Other sites may blacklist the organization's domain and automatically reject legitimate email correspondence.
- Service disruptions, to the point when organization's resources become unavailable, either temporarily or permanently.
