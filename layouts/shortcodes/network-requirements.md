The Cobalt security assessment team carries out testing **without** the following, unless it's required as part of the pentest scope:

- Detailed network or infrastructure diagrams
- Any accounts or additional user information

However, you're welcome to add network diagrams and other details when [describing your asset](/getting-started/assets/asset-description/).
