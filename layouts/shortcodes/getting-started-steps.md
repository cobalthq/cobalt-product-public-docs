Refer to the [Getting Started](/getting-started/) guide to set up a pentest in several stages.

To launch an In-House Pentest with your team, see [Run an In-House Pentest (For Managers)](/pmp/manage-pentests/).

Once the pentest is complete, you can download a [pentest report](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/) to explore security issues that our pentesters found.
