Refer to the [Getting Started](/getting-started/) guide to set up a pentest in four stages:

1. Define your [assets](/getting-started/assets/).
1. Set pentest [requirements](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/).
1. Add pentest [details](/getting-started/details/).
1. [Plan and scope](/getting-started/planning/) the pentest.

Once the pentest is complete, you can download a [pentest report](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/) to explore security issues that our pentesters found.
