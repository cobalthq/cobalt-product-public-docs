During the initial phase of testing, pentesters determine what information is publicly available. They examine the following:

- **Your corporate website**. Cobalt pentesters evaluate your website in ways that could interest a potential attacker, including:
  - Locations (URLs)
  - Contact details (such as phone numbers, email, and physical addresses)
  - Domain information
  - Links to other servers within an organization
  - Other companies with links to your website
  - Information on the security policy of your organization
- **Other web locations and databases**. Cobalt pentesters search for information on your asset from other websites and databases, especially anything related to publicly traded companies. Pentesters then evaluate what information the organization makes public, especially anything that goes beyond what's required by local laws. They also evaluate news articles and press releases for more clues about your security policy.
- **Your domain names**. Cobalt pentesters use "whois" databases to identify the domains that you own. These domains provide information about your network infrastructure.
- **Public records**. Public records about your organization may include information about the people responsible for administering your domain, such as their name, address, or phone number. Attackers may use social engineering to get additional information, such as the details of hardware and software purchases. It also gives clues about where the best place to target an attack may be.
