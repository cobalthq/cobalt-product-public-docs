Based on the results of the initial port scan, our pentesters work to identify:

- The types of applications running on externally exposed machines
- Version numbers for identified software
- Operating systems on which the software runs

In some cases, an externally exposed machine may have open services that don't have functions associated with them. Pentesters can identify and target them for testing.
