You can delete the integration with Jira.

1. In Cobalt, navigate to **Integrations** > **Jira**, and then select **Delete**.

1. In the Jira admin panel, uninstall the Jira plugin.

Here’s what to expect once you’ve deleted the connection:

- Data synchronization between Cobalt and Jira stops.
- All Jira configurations for specific pentests are deleted. If you decide to reestablish the connection, you need to reconfigure the integration for each pentest.
