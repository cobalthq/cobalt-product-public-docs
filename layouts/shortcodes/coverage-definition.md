The Cobalt coverage checklist is a list of checks that pentesters use throughout a pentest to ensure that a baseline of security controls are in place. The list is based on security standards such as [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/).
