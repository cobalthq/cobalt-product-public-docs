Cobalt pentesters report and triage all vulnerabilities during the assessment. You
can review details of all [findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/), in real time, through the Cobalt platform. In these findings, as well as in any [report](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/), our pentesters include detailed
information on how you can:

- Remediate each finding
- Improve your overall security posture

You can [remediate findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/) during and after the pentest. Then you can submit findings for retest. Our pentesters test the updated components and retest issues to ensure that there are no security-related residual risks.
