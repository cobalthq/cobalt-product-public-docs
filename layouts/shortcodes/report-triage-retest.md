Our pentesters report and triage all vulnerabilities during the assessment. You
can review details of all findings, in real time, through the Cobalt platform.
In these findings, as well as in any report, our pentesters include detailed
information on how you can:

- Remediate each finding
- Improve your overall security posture

If you remediate findings during the supported pentest period, our pentesters
can retest your updated components against each discovered vulnerability.
