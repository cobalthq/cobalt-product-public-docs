Cobalt pentesters report and triage all vulnerabilities during the assessment. You
can review details of all [findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/), in real time, through the Cobalt platform. In these findings, as well as in any [report](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/), Cobaltâ€™s pentesters include detailed information, including:

- Step-by-step remediation guidance
- Recommendations on how to improve your overall security posture


You can [remediate findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/) during and after the pentest. Then you can submit findings for retest. Our pentesters test the updated components and retest vulnerabilities to ensure that there are no security-related residual risks.
