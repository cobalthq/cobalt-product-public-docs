As certain vulnerabilities and exploits could paralyze, damage, or alter the content of the network, our pentesters do not perform these attacks. They do make note of the possible risks. For example, our pentesters won't run exploits that:

- Disable certain services
- Deny service from outside systems
- May affect customers (such as with a Denial of Service (DoS) attack)
- Disable the ability of an organization to function
