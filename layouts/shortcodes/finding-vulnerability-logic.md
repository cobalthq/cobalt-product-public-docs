When you select [Full Report + Finding Details](/getting-started/what-to-expect/report-contents/)
in a [Pentest Report](/getting-started/what-to-expect/report-contents/), you'll get
an Appendix of [Finding Details](/getting-started/what-to-expect/report-contents/#appendix-a---finding-details).

Each [finding](/getting-started/glossary/#finding) includes a [vulnerability type](/getting-started/glossary/#vulnerability-type). As a whole, each finding shown in the Appendix of Finding
Details is a manual [Vulnerability Report](/getting-started/glossary/#vulnerability-report-manual).
