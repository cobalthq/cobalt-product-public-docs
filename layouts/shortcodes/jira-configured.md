Here's what to expect once you've enabled the integration:

- The **Auto-Push** option is enabled for the pentest by default. When a new finding in the Pending Fix [state](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/finding-states/) is reported, a new issue is automatically created in Jira. Learn more about [how auto-push works](/integrations/jira/push-findings/#how-auto-push-works).
- Pentest Team Members can push findings manuallyâ€”if they're not already synchronized. Learn [how to push findings manually](/integrations/jira/push-findings/#push-findings-manually).
- You can view the integration status and parameters on the **Integrations** tab of the pentest page. You can adjust the configuration for specific pentests.
- On the **Jira Integration** page, you can see the time when the last finding was synchronized.
