All connections to the internet typically go through a border router managed by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). However, sometimes routers remain unpatched for an extended period, or default user accounts remain active.

We locate all visible routers, establish the manufacturer and operating system (OS), then check for potential vulnerabilities. Our tests include:

- Checking software, to make sure your routers are patched and up to date
- Default user accounts such as `admin`
- Attempts to access the router using various databases of well-known default passwords and settings
