**Best practices for creating an asset**:

- Describe your asset as clearly as possible.
- Add a product walk-through and asset documentation using the [provided templates](/getting-started/assets/asset-description/#attachments).
- Keep your assets up to date.
- Start creating or editing your asset before creating a pentest. You can reuse the asset for future pentests.
