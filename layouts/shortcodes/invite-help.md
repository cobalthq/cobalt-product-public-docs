### Invite Help

You may not have all the information that you need. To invite others to help define your pentest,
look for the Add Collaborator icon:

![Add Collaborator](/gsg/Collaborator.png "Email someone within your company for help.")

If you select the icon, we save the current pentest, in draft format. We then prompt you for an
email address of a coworker who could have more information about your pentest needs.

Next, your coworker receives an email to sign up for Cobalt, with a link directly to the pentest
that you're working on.
