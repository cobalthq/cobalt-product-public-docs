Other users can view your profile information. To edit your profile, navigate to https://app.cobalt.io/settings/profile.

On the **Profile settings** page, you can:

- Upload a user profile image.

When finished, select **Update Profile** to confirm.

## Update Account Settings

To edit general account settings, select **Account Settings** on the user menu.

### Change Your Username

You can create a custom username for your account.

1. Navigate to https://app.cobalt.io/settings/account.
1. In the **Username** field, enter a new username.
1. Select **Save Changes** to confirm.

### Change Your Password

You can change your password by resetting it.

1. Navigate to https://app.cobalt.io/settings/account.
1. Select **Change Password**.
1. Follow the instructions in the email that you receive to reset your password. Learn [how to create a strong password](/platform-deep-dive/cobalt-account/password-best-practices/).

If you're using Google authentication (OAuth 2.0), sign in with your email and password, and then change your password.

If you [forgot your password](/platform-deep-dive/cobalt-account/account-recovery/#forgot-your-password), you can reset it from the Sign In page.

## Manage Security Settings

To manage two-factor authentication (2FA) settings for your account, select **Security Settings** on the user menu.

### Two-Factor Authentication

#### Enable Two-Factor Authentication

If you're **signing in with your email and password**, you will only be able to access your account after enabling two-factor authentication. In case it's not configured, you will be required to do so right after signing in. 2FA adds another layer of security to your account by asking for more than just a password.

Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the process. Use an authenticator of your choice, such as [Authy](https://authy.com/) or [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447).

{{% image src="/deepdive/CopyRecoveryCode.png" alt="Copy Recovery Code" %}}

After selecting Continue, you will see your [recovery code](/getting-started/glossary/#recovery-code). Save the code. After you close the overlay, you wonâ€™t see the code again.

> If you're signing in through single sign-on, 2FA doesn't apply. This includes [SAML SSO](/getting-started/sign-in/#saml-sso) and OAuth.

#### Manage 2FA Devices

{{% image src="/deepdive/Manage2FA.png" alt="Manage 2FA" %}}

When you add a new 2FA device, it appears on the account security page<!--under **Current Devices**-->. Here, you can see the authenticator app that generates one-time codes required for authentication to your Cobalt account.

#### Reset Two-Factor Authentication

We don't recommend turning off 2FA on your account. However, you may need to reset your 2FA methods when your authenticator device was lost or stolen.

You can remove your current 2FA device and add a new one for added security, assuming you're still signed in or marked your machine to be remembered for 30 days (during sign-in).

To remove a 2FA device:

{{% image src="/deepdive/RemoveAuthenticatorDevice.png" alt="Remove authenticator device" %}}

1. Navigate to https://app.cobalt.io/settings/security/2fa.
1. Under **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, select **Manage**.
1. Locate the desired device, and select the trash icon.

Now you can add a new 2FA device to protect your account.

If you lost access to your authenticator and don't have access to the security setting anymore, ask your Organization Owner to turn off 2FA or use your recovery code. For details, see [Lost Access to Your Authenticator](/platform-deep-dive/cobalt-account/account-recovery/#lost-access-to-your-authenticator).
