## New Carried Over Findings Section  

We've added a new "Carried Over Findings" section to individual findings with a previous history. This feature provides a clear view of a finding’s lifecycle, allowing you to easily see when and where it was first reported. For findings with extensive history, you can simply expand or collapse the list. 

Additionally, an indicator in the finding’s title will now clearly show that it is a carried-over finding.

## Updated Findings CSV Download

The downloadable CSV from the findings page has been updated with new data and cleaner column headers, providing greater clarity on previously reported findings. The updated file now includes three new data points for a more complete history:

- **First Reported At**: The date a finding was first reported in a previous pentest.
- **First Reported Tag**: The unique tag of the initial pentest where the finding appeared.
- **Previously Reported Count**: The total number of times the finding has been previously reported.
