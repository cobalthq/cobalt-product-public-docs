help you secure your systems.

You want to start an [application security](../getting-started/glossary/#application-security-appsec)
program. You've read through the 2021 version of the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/).
We'll provide practical examples that you can use as patterns to secure your
[assets](../getting-started/glossary/#assets). We'll revise our work to help you
focus on the message, not on understanding the wording.

<!-- This seems really close to suggesting that our "docs are easy to read", which we want to avoid -->

<!-- Plan: set up subdirectories based on each OWASP Top 10 entry. Add an `_index.md` file, with a brief description from https://owasp.org/Top10/ and add each article in that subdirectory -->

## Available Articles

Once we've merged content into this guide, we'll list them in the following table with the
date of release.
