You want to start an [application security](../getting-started/glossary/#application-security-appsec)
program. You've read through the 2021 version of the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/).
We'll provide practical examples that you can use as patterns to secure your
[assets](../getting-started/glossary/#assets).
