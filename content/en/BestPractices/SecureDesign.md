# Prevent Insecure Design # 

# Description #

Insecure design flaws are failures to follow secure design and architecture best practices by the developers, starting from the planning phase of the application. This is a broad category representing different security weaknesses collectively known as insecure design.

# Examples #
Let’s explore some examples of Insecure Design

## Scenario 1 ##

**Overly Permissive Application Database User**

The application database user has the privileges of the database administrator. An attacker exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability in the application can get access to the complete database. Moreover, the privilege allows the attacker to run operating system commands, which could lead to server compromise. 
  
Secure design recommends the least privileges for application database users. Since the secure design practices were not followed during the planning phase, the application database user was granted the default admin permissions. The impact of SQL injection can be contained if the permissions of database user are restricted.  

## Scenario 2 ##

**Missing Access Control**

An access control issue was found in the production application, where the attacker was able to access the superadmin dashboard and get access to the data of other users. The superadmin dashboard URL was guessed by the attacker, and due to missing access control, it granted full access to the superadmin account. 

A detailed threat modelling could have pointed out this scenario where an application user could access superadmin account. The threat model could also have recommended the developers implement strong access control, separating superadmin area of the application from the user side. 

## Scenario 3 ##

**Missing Rate Limiting**

Missing rate limiting in the coupon code in an eCommerce website leads to bots trying to bruteforce the coupon codes, attracting unnecessary traffic which leads to performance issues. 

Since this was not anticipated during the design phase, there wasn’t any preventive control to avoid this. A secure design with an application firewall to protect any bot activity and a lockout mechanism could have avoided this issue.


# Prevention #

To avoid insecure design flaws, you must:

- Collect security requirements along with business requirements, ensure sufficient resources and efforts to implement security controls as well. 

- Document abuse cases along with use cases while creating user stories. Bring security concerns during the discussions in developer meetings.

- Conduct threat modelling exercises. Dissect different functionalities and use case stories to arrive at possible threats and vulnerabilities. Take the help of security experts to enumerate threats. Create a mitigation strategy to handle possible attack scenarios.

- Conduct secure design and architecture reviews along with the security team. This highlights flaws in existing architecture and proposes solutions to create a robust design. 

- Create feedback loops, vulnerabilities identified later during the testing phase or in the production environment can help to revise threat models over time. 

- Establish a secure development lifecycle with the help of security teams. Introduce secure design principles and security checks early in the development lifecycle. 

- You can also follow [OpenSAMM](https://www.opensamm.org/) framework, an open-source framework for implementing a strategy for software security. This model can be applied organization-wide, for a single line of business, or even for an individual project and for any style of development.
