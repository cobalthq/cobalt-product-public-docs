From the moment you've started saving a draft of a pentest, you'll see a label
associated with that pentest in various locations. We've set up these definitions
as if you've set up the pentest through our user interface. Here's the meaning of each
label:

| Label       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Draft       | You’ve started the **Create a Pentest** process. However, you may not have added the information that we need to start work on your pentest.                                                                                              |
| In Review   | You’ve submitted the pentest. We’re reviewing your submission. We may have questions for you as we review your submission.                                                                                                                |
| Planned     | We’ve accepted your proposed pentest, and have assigned pentesters. You should also have access to a Slack channel dedicated to your pentest.                                                                                             |
| Live        | We’ve started working on your pentest. Watch your Slack channel. When we have questions and discover findings, we’ll share them in the channel.                                                                                           |
| Paused      | We’re unable to continue the pentest. You should see a reason in the Slack channel associated with your pentest.                                                                                                                          |
| Remediation | We’ve shared the results of our pentest, including our vulnerability findings. You can either accept the vulnerabilities or remediate them. Once complete, you can resubmit your request. We’ll then retest your asset.                   |
| Closed      | In most cases, we’ve retested your asset, based on what you’ve done to remediate any vulnerabilities that we’ve found. In rare cases, we may have not found any vulnerabilities, or you’ve accepted any vulnerabilities that we’ve found. |
| Cancelled   | If you no longer need a pentest, you’re always welcome to cancel it. We’ll keep the pentest in our records in case you change your mind.                                                                                                  |
