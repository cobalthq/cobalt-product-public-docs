## Request a Beta Integration

Request to enable a beta integration for your next pentest to streamline your remediation workflows. Customize the configuration to suit your needs, and start pushing Cobalt findings to your preferred task management software:

- Azure DevOps
- Bitbucket
- ServiceNow

Beta integrations are fully functional connectors that we’ve developed using [Workato](https://www.workato.com/)—a workflow automation platform that enables greater flexibility to tailor our integrations to customers' unique workflows.
