To get started, navigate to the **Integrations** page in the Cobalt app.

- Set up **Native** integrations in the Cobalt app to push Cobalt data to external apps. Here, you can also create [webhooks](/integrations/webhooks/) to get real-time pentest updates.
- Enable **Partner** integrations in third-party apps. You need an [API token](/apiusecases/create_asset/#create-an-api-token-in-the-cobalt-ui) to pull Cobalt data to external apps.
