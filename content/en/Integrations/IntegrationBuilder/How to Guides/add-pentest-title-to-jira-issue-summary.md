This guide is designed to help [**Integration Builder**](/integrations/integrationbuilder/) users customize the summary field of 
Jira issues created by their recipes to contain the title of the relevant pentest.
Please follow the [Create Jira tickets for Findings guide](/integrations/integrationbuilder/how-to-guides/jira-cloud-migration) before proceeding with this guide.

1. Navigate to the __[Cobalt > Jira Cloud] Push pentest finding to Jira__ recipe that you set up while [following the previous guide](/integrations/integrationbuilder/how-to-guides/jira-cloud-migration).

2. Open the edit view for the recipe by clicking the __Edit__ button.

3. Hover your cursor above the __Monitor__ block that encapsulates the __Create issue in Jira__ action. An __Add step__ button will appear. Click on it.

6. Choose the __Get pentest__ action.

7. You now need to map the ID of the pentest associated to the finding into the __Pentest ID__ input field.
   Once you click into the __Pentest ID__ input field, the __Recipe data__ drawer will open.
   Within the __Recipe data__ drawer, look for the __Pentest finding state updated__ trigger and expand it to see all of its outputs.
   Find the __Pentest ID__ output and click on it to map it to the __Pentest ID__ input field.

8. Click on the __Retry__ action that is below the __Get pentest__ action. Configure it to retry 3 times and to wait 5 seconds between retries.
   This gives the recipe a decent chance to automatically recover from any network failures.

9. Below the __Retry__ block, there is an arrow labeled __if error persists__. Below this arrow there is an empty action slot. 
   Hover over it and click the elipsis that appears to the right of the action slot.
   In the menu that appears, click __Delete__ to remove the action slot.

10. Hover in the area where you deleted the action slot until the __Add step__ button appears. Click the __Add step__ button.

11. Choose the __Stop job__ option.

![choose stop job](/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/add-pentest-title-to-jira-issue-summary/10_choose_stop_job.png)

12. Click on the __Stop job__ action. In the configuration pane that opens on the right, you will see a few options.
    Set the __In job report, mark stopped job as__ field to __Failed__.
    Use the __Recipe data__ drawer to map the __Error message__ output from the __Retry__ action into the __Reason for failure__ input field.
