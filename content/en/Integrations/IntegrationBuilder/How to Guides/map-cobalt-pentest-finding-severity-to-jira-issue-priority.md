This guide is designed to help [**Integration Builder**](/integrations/integrationbuilder/) users map the severity of pentest findings in Cobalt to the priority of new Jira issues.
Please follow the [Create Jira tickets for Findings guide](/integrations/integrationbuilder/how-to-guides/jira-cloud-migration) before proceeding with this guide.

## Basic Option

1. Navigate to the __[Cobalt > Jira Cloud] Push pentest finding to Jira__ recipe that you set up while [following the previous guide](/integrations/integrationbuilder/how-to-guides/jira-cloud-migration).

2. Open the edit view for the recipe by clicking the __Edit__ button.

3. Find the __Create Jira Issue__ action in the recipe and click on it.

4. In the pane that opens on the right, scroll down until you see the __Issue Priority__ field. 
   Click into the dropdown so that you can see the options that are displayed. Take note of them, you will need them later.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/6_create_variable_action.png" alt="create variable" %}}

9. Click the __Add a variable__ button.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/7_add_variable.png" alt="add a variable" %}}

10. Name the variable `jira_issue_priority` and click __Add variable__.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/8_name_variable.png" alt="name variable" %}}

11. Below the __create variable__ action that you added, add a new step with the __if condition__ type.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/9_add_if_condition.png" alt="add if condition" %}}

12. Click on the __if condition__ that you created so that the configuration pane opens on the right. Once it opens, click the __data field__ input.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/10_click_data_field.png" alt="click data field" %}}

13. In the recipe data drawer, find the __Get pentest finding__ action. Use the arrow to the right of the action to see all of its output fields. Select the __Severity__ field.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/11_chose_finding_severity.png" alt="choose finding severity" %}}

14. In the if condition configuration pane, click the __condition__ input field and choose the __equals__ option.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/12_set_if_condition.png" alt="set if condition" %}}

15. In the __value__ input field, enter the Cobalt finding severity that you want to map to a Jira issue priority. You can find all Cobalt finding severities listed [here](https://cobalt-public-api.netlify.app/v2/#get-all-findings).

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/13_set_if_value.png" alt="set if value" %}}

16. Click on the empty action slot nested under the __if condition__. In the configuration pane that opens on the right, click the __Variables by workato__ connector.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/14_select_if_action.png" alt="select if action" %}}

17. Select the __update variables__ action.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/15_update_variable.png" alt="update variable" %}}

18. In the __variable name__ input field, select the `jira_issue_priority` variable that you created earlier.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/16_select_jira_issue_priority_var.png" alt="select jira issue priority variable" %}}

19. In the `jira_issue_priority` input field, enter the Jira issue priority that you want to map to the Cobalt finding severity that you set in the if condition. Type the priority exactly as you noted it earlier.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/17_put_jira_priority_in_variable.png" alt="enter issue priority" %}}

20. Add more if conditions for each severity that you want to map to a Jira issue priority. You can add as many if conditions as you need.

21. Once you have added all the if conditions that you need, click the __Create issue in Jira__ action in the recipe.

22. In the configuration pane on the right, scroll down until you see the __Issue priority__ input field. Click on the dropdown that says __Select from list__ and choose the __Use priority name__ option.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/18_use_priority_name.png" alt="use priority name" %}}

23. Map the `jira_issue_priority` variable that you created earlier to the __Issue priority__ input field.

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/19_set_issue_priority.png" alt="set issue priority" %}}

{{% image src="/integrations/integration_builder/how_to_guides/map-cobalt-pentest-finding-severity-to-jira-issue-priority/20_what_it_should_look_like.png" alt="how it should look" %}}

24. That's it! Click save.

## Advanced Option

If you have multiple recipes that push pentest findings to Jira, you can create a reusable recipe that maps Cobalt finding severity to Jira issue priority. This way, you can use the same recipe in multiple places without having to recreate the mapping logic each time.
