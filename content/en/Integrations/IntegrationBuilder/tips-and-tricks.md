## Trigger filters

Trigger filters can be used to limit the scope of a recipe trigger.
For example, if you are using the `Pentest finding state updated` trigger and you only want your recipe to be triggered
when the finding whose state was updated is associated to a certain asset or pentest, you can use trigger filters for this.

To see the filters available for a trigger, click on your trigger and then click the `optional fields available` button.

You may then select the filters to add.

![Add filters](/integrations/integration_builder/tips_and_tricks/trigger_filters/add_filters.png "Add filters")

You can then set the value of the trigger.
Some trigger filters accept a textual input.
Some trigger filters have a dropdown box that may be used to select a value.
Some trigger filters support both textual input and dropdown selections.
