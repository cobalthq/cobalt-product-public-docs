With our [beta integrations](/integrations/beta/), you can push Cobalt [findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/) to your preferred task management software.

To configure the integration, complete the following steps:

1. In the Cobalt app, [create a webhook](#step-1-create-a-webhook) to trigger integration events.
1. [Sign in to your Workato workspace](#step-2-sign-in-to-your-workato-workspace).
1. [Connect to your Cobalt account](#step-3-connect-to-your-cobalt-account).
1. [Authenticate to the connected app](#step-4-authenticate-to-the-connected-app).

## What You Need

To complete the configuration, you need the following:

- **Webhook URL**: URL that is used in the configuration to send integration events. We'll send you your webhook URL in the onboarding email.
- **Organization token**: Unique organization token used in API calls. We'll send you your organization token in the onboarding email.
- **API token**: Your personal API token required to authorize access to the Cobalt API. Learn [how to create an API token](/cobalt-api/create-personal-api-token/).
- **Integration credentials**: Credentials for the connected platform.

## Step 1: Create a Webhook

Prior to your onboarding call with our Integrations team, you'll receive an email from us with the subject line `Cobalt Beta Integration Onboarding Details`. The email contains your **Webhook URL**.

Create a webhook using the **Webhook URL** from the email. For instructions, see [Create a Webhook](/integrations/webhooks/#create-a-webhook). Make sure that the webhook is active.

1. To set up your account, enter your name and email address, and create a password. Select **Create your account** to confirm.
1. Once signed in, select your name in the upper-left corner, and then select the workspace with your company name.
1. On the welcome page of the integration center, select **Get started**.

## Step 3: Connect to Your Cobalt Account

Once you've signed in to your Workato workspace, you need to authenticate to your Cobalt account.

1. In your Workato workspace, under **Projects**, select **Connections**.
1. Select **Cobalt Connection**.
1. Enter the following:
    - **Bearer token**: Paste the **API Token** that you created. Learn [how to create an API token](/cobalt-api/create-personal-api-token/).
