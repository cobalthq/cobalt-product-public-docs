Beta integrations are fully functional connectors that we’ve developed using [Workato](https://www.workato.com/)—a workflow automation platform that enables greater flexibility to tailor our integrations to customers' unique workflows.

<p>You can request to enable a beta integration for a <b>single pentest</b>. Submit your request <b>at least 10 business days prior to the start date of your pentest</b> to allow time for configuration and testing.</p><p>{{< tier-feature-html>}} We'll make every effort to accommodate all requests, but we can't guarantee that we'll fulfill all requests. We'll prioritize requests based on the pentest schedule.</p>

To opt in to the beta program:
