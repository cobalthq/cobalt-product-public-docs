## Overview

As an [Organization Owner](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-owner) or [Member](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-member), you can integrate Jira with Cobalt to streamline your workflows. With this integration, you can:

- **Push Cobalt findings as issues** to your Jira project.
  - The [auto-push](/integrations/jira/push-findings/#how-auto-push-works) option allows you to push findings to Jira automatically.
  - Pentest collaborators can also [push findings manually](/integrations/jira/push-findings/#push-findings-manually)â€”if they're not already synchronized.
- **Synchronize the status of Jira issues with Cobalt findings** once your team has completed remediation.

The integration works through **Cobalt plugins for Jira** available on the Atlassian Marketplace.
