## Introduction

The document offers detailed, step-by-step instructions on utilizing **Integration Builder** recipes to establish bidirectional synchronization between a Cobalt pentest finding and a Jira issue. The level of automation in your workflow is directly related to the number of recipes you configure to tailor the behavior to your specific requirements. See more on how the recipes work and the basic concept [here](integrations/integrationbuilder/#how-it-works).

> ⚠️ Please note that this migration guide is not applicable if your organization uses a native **Jira Server** or a **Jira Data Center** integration.
