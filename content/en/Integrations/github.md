## Integration Overview

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.

You can configure a **one-way integration** with GitHub to push Cobalt [findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/) as issues to your GitHub repository.

- You can only push findings manually, one finding at a time.
- You need a personal GitHub access token. The integration supports both classic and fine-grained access tokens. Learn more about the [token types](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#types-of-personal-access-tokens).
  - For a fine-grained token, make sure that it has read and write access to issues and read access to metadata.
- The following finding fields are sent to GitHub:
  - Title
  - URL
  - Description
  - Suggested Fix

## Configure the Integration

As an [Organization Owner](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-owner) or [Member](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-member), you can enable the GitHub integration for a specific pentest.

1. In Cobalt, navigate to **Pentests**, and select the desired pentest.
1. Go to the **Integrations** tab.
1. Follow the instructions in the UI under **GitHub**.<br><br>

## Push Findings to GitHub

Once you've enabled the integration, you can push findings to your GitHub repository.

- We recommend pushing findings in the Pending Fix state. Learn more about the [finding states](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/finding-states/).
- Because it's a one-way integration, any changes made to the finding in Cobalt are not synchronized with GitHub. You can add these details manually on GitHub.
- You can only push a finding once.

To push a finding to GitHub:

1. On the pentest page, go to the **Findings** tab, and select the desired finding.
1. Select **External Issue Tracking**, then select **Create issue on GitHub**.<br><br>
  ![Push a Cobalt finding to GitHub](/integrations/push-finding-to-GitHub.png "Push a Cobalt finding to GitHub")

A new issue is created in your GitHub repository, and the issue number appears under **External Issue Tracking** in Cobalt. Click the link to navigate to the issue.

## Deactivate the Integration

You may want to deactivate the integration with GitHub for a specific pentest.

1. In Cobalt, navigate to **Pentests**, and select the desired pentest.
1. Go to the **Integrations** tab.
1. Under **GitHub**, select **Remove**.

You can no longer push findings for this pentest to GitHub.
