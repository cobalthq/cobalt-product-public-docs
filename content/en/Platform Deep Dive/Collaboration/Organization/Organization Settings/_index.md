## Edit the Organization Profile

Both [Organization Owners](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-owner) and [Members](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-member) can edit the organization profile on the **General** tab in **Settings**:

- Upload an image for their organization.
- Edit the name and slug. The slug appears in the URL.

## Manage Security Settings

Only [Organization Owners](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-owner) can manage identity and access settings:

- [Enforce two-factor authentication](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/organization/organization-settings/enforce-2fa/) for all users within the organization.
- Configure [SAML-based single sign-on (SSO)](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/organization/organization-settings/saml-sso/).
