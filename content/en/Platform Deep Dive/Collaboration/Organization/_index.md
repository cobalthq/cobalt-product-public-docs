When you receive an email invitation from Cobalt, you join a specific organization with a role assigned to you. Within an organization, you and your team get access to the Cobalt platform and the pentest experience.

You can view the organization you belong to in the Cobalt app. If you joined multiple organizations, you can switch between them.

## Download Your Organization's Pentest Data

To export pentest data for your organization, you can:

- Use the Cobalt API. Read our [API documentation](https://docs.cobalt.io/v2/) for details. You can send API requests to retrieve pentest data, such as:
  - [All pentests](https://docs.cobalt.io/v2/#get-all-pentests)
  - [All findings](https://docs.cobalt.io/v2/#get-all-findings)
  - [A pentest report](https://docs.cobalt.io/v2/#get-a-pentest-report)
- Manually download [findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/) and [reports](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/) for each pentest in the Cobalt app. Select the <i style="font-size:x-large; color: #0047AB" class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> key for instructions.
