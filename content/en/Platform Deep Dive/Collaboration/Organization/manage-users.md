## Manage Users for Your Organization

As an [Organization Owner](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-owner), you can manage users for your organization on the **People** page > **Organization**:

- [Invite](#invite-users) and [remove](#remove-users) users
- [Change their roles](#change-a-users-role)

![Organization tab on the People page](/deepdive/PeopleOrganization.png "View and manage users for your organization on the People page")

### Invite Users

To invite users to your organization:

1. In the Cobalt app, select your organization.
1. Navigate to the **People** page, and select **Invite People**.
1. In the overlay that appears, specify the email addresses of users that you want to invite. Enter the emails, and press Enter to confirm.
   - Use commas to separate multiple email addresses.
1. For each user, select a [role](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/organization/user-roles/): Member or Owner.
    - Both Members and Owners have access to all [assets](/platform-deep-dive/assets/) and [pentests](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/) of an organization.
1. Select **Invite** to confirm.

Users receive an email invitation to join your organization. They also become collaborators on all pentests of the organization as [Pentest Team Members](/getting-started/glossary/#pentest-team-member).

<!--If an email address is invalid or a user has already joined, you see an error message.-->

    - From the organization and all pentests.

## Add and Remove Pentest Team Members
