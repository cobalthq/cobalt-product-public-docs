## Pentest Team Member

A Pentest Team Member is a customer (organization) representative during a specific pentest. In the UI, you see this role as "Team Member."

- A Pentest Team Member does not have to be an [Organization Owner](#organization-owner) or an [Organization Member](#organization-member).
- When an Organization Owner [invites a user to an organization](/platform-deep-dive/organization/manage-users/#invite-users), the user also becomes a Pentest Team Member on all pentests of the organization.
  - An Organization Owner can [remove a Pentest Team Member from all pentests](/platform-deep-dive/organization/manage-users/#remove-a-user-from-all-pentests) they collaborate on.
  - Any Pentest Team Member can [add users](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/manage-collaborators/#add-a-pentest-team-member) to a specific pentest or [remove](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/manage-collaborators/#remove-a-pentest-team-member) them.

A Pentest Team Member **has access to a specific pentest with the following permissions**:

- View and edit pentest details.
- [Collaborate on a pentest](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/collaborate-on-pentests/) in the Cobalt app and in Slack.
- [Manage users](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/manage-collaborators/) for a pentest.
- View pentest activity updates and pentester updates.
- Manage integrations for a pentest: Jira and GitHub.

## Cobalt Pentesters

When you run pentests using the Cobalt Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform, Cobalt pentesters participate in the process. This group includes the following roles:

- [Pentester](#pentester)
- [Lead](#lead)
- [Coordinator](#coordinator)

### Pentester

A Pentester is a Cobalt pentester who completes pentests for Cobalt customers.

The responsibilities of a Pentester include:

- Thoroughly test an asset for vulnerabilities based on the pentest scope and requirements.
- Submit vulnerabilities ([findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/)) and provide remediation tips.
- Retest findings that the customer has remediated within a pentest.
- Collaborate with the customer throughout a pentest.

Some Cobalt pentesters may be a Lead in one test, a Pentester in a second test, and possibly no role and no involvement in your other pentests.

### Lead

A pentest Lead is a Cobalt pentester who leads other Cobalt pentesters in their efforts to complete a [Comprehensive pentest](/getting-started/glossary/#comprehensive-pentest). A pentest Lead also drafts a [pentest report](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/).

For [Agile pentests](/getting-started/glossary/#agile-pentest), the corresponding role is [Coordinator](#coordinator).

### Coordinator

A pentest Coordinator is a Cobalt pentester who leads other Cobalt pentesters in their efforts to complete an [Agile pentest](/getting-started/glossary/#agile-pentest).

## In-House Pentester

An In-House Pentester is a pentester invited by a customer (organization) to perform In-House pentests on the Cobalt [Pentest Management Platform (PMP)](/pmp/). An In-House Pentester role has the same privileges as a [Pentest Team Member](#pentest-team-member), with additional access to pentester functionality.

A customer can invite pentesters from their organization, a third-party company, or both to complete In-House pentests on the Cobalt [Pentest Management Platform (PMP)](/pmp/).
