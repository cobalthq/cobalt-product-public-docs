Make sure you add the right people from your organization to a pentest. You can discuss pentest details and follow up on [findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/) together. To learn more, see [Collaborate on Pentests](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/collaborate-on-pentests/).

As an [Organization Owner](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/user-roles/#organization-owner), you can [manage users](/platform-deep-dive/organization/manage-users/) and [adjust settings](/platform-deep-dive/organization/organization-settings/) for your organization.
