{{% asset-types-table %}}

For assets of multiple types, you may want to set up one or more pentests, depending on the characteristics of your software.

{{%expand "Learn more." %}}

For example, if your asset combines a web and mobile application, you may want us to test them together, in one pentest, if:

- The two applications share some of the same code and functionalities.
- One pentest report is sufficient for your purposes.
- One team is responsible for both applications.

Otherwise, you may need to set up two pentests to get more granular results.
