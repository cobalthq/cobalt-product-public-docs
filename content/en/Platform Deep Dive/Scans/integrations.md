{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Overview

The DAST ticketing integration allows you to push your DAST findings to your ticketing system as soon as vulnerabilities are detected.
At this time, the integration supports the following ticketing systems:

* Jira Cloud
* GitHub Issues
* Azure DevOps Boards

## How it Works

The DAST ticketing integration uses Cobalt's [Integration Builder](/integrations/integrationbuilder) to push DAST findings to your ticketing system.
The integration builder is a no-code workflow builder that enables you to create highly customizable integrations.
We provide integration quickstart templates for the above-mentioned ticketing systems that allow you to get your DAST integration up and running quickly!
