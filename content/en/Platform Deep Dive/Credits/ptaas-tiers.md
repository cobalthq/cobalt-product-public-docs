## View Your Organization's Tier

As an [Organization Owner](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/user-roles/#organization-owner) or [Member](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/user-roles/#organization-member), you can view your organization's tier on the [**Credits** page](/platform-deep-dive/credits/track-credits/). In the UI, it appears as **Subscription Plan**.
- For some organizations, we don't show their subscription plan on the **Credits** page.
