They follow a coverage checklist based on [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) standards to test your assets. |
| Detailed findings with recommended fixes | All | When our pentesters find a [vulnerability](/getting-started/glossary/#vulnerability) in your [asset](/getting-started/glossary/#asset) during a pentest, they submit [findings](/getting-started/glossary/#finding) and provide recommendations on how to fix them. |

Mark your findings as Ready for Retest at least 10 days before your contract ends. |

| Dedicated pentester region or time zone | Enterprise | We work with you to understand the region and time zone you need for your pentesters and identify pentesters from our community in those regions or time zones. Dedicated pentester regions or time zones may have an impact on the time it takes to start a pentest. This does not mean that we support data localization, as required by some countries.  |
