## Protect Your Personal Data

You may want to **anonymize or delete your account data** in compliance with [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/). For more information, read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.cobalt.io/terms#privacy).

- [Rights of the data subject](https://gdpr.eu/tag/chapter-3/)
- [Right to erasure ('right to be forgotten')](https://gdpr.eu/article-17-right-to-be-forgotten/)

- When a user requests to **anonymize** their account data, we obfuscate user details using a one-way function that prevents identifying the user in any way.
- When a user requests to **delete** their account data, we erase all user’s personal data from our system.

To anonymize or delete your Cobalt account, send a request to privacy@cobalt.io from the email address that you used to set up your account. Include your account details in the email. We'll process your request within 30 days.

Anonymizing or deleting your account is **irreversible**. If you no longer want to belong to your organization or collaborate on pentests, ask your [Organization Owner](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-owner) to [remove you from the organization](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/organization/manage-users/#remove-users) or specific [pentest](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/organization/manage-users/#remove-a-pentest-team-member). In this case, you don't need to delete your account.
