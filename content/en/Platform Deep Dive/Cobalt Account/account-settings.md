If you're using Google authentication (OAuth 2.0), sign in with your email and password, and then change your password.

If you [forgot your password](/platform-deep-dive/cobalt-account/account-recovery/#forgot-your-password), you can reset it from the Sign In page.

## Manage Security Settings

To manage two-factor authentication (2FA) settings for your account, select **Security Settings** on the user menu.

### Two-Factor Authentication

#### Enable Two-Factor Authentication

If you're **signing in with your email and password**, you can enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect your account. 2FA adds another layer of security to your account by requiring more than just a password to sign in.

- Even if your organization doesn't [enforce 2FA](/platform-deep-dive/organization/organization-settings/enforce-2fa/) for all users, we recommend that you enable it to enhance your account security.
- If you're signing in through single sign-on, 2FA doesn't apply. This includes [SAML SSO](/getting-started/sign-in/#saml-sso) and OAuth.

To enable 2FA on your account:

1. Navigate to https://app.cobalt.io/settings/security/2fa.
2. Under **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, select **Manage**, and reauthenticate to your account.
3. To add a new authenticator device, select **Set Up**.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the process. Use an authenticator of your choice, such as [Authy](https://authy.com/) or [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447).
5. After selecting **Continue**, you will see your recovery code. Save the code. After you close the overlay, you wonâ€™t see the code again.

Now, each time you sign in to Cobalt, you must enter a one-time code from your authenticator app. If you have problems signing in with 2FA, see our [troubleshooting tips](/platform-deep-dive/cobalt-account/account-recovery/#problems-with-two-factor-authentication).

#### Manage 2FA Devices

When you add a new 2FA device, it appears on the account security page<!--under **Current Devices**-->. Here, you can see the authenticator app that generates one-time codes required for authentication to your Cobalt account.

- **Remove an app** if it's no longer valid or has been lost or stolen. Select **Delete**, and confirm your action.

#### Reset Two-Factor Authentication

We don't recommend turning off 2FA on your account. However, you may need to reset your 2FA methods when:

- Your authenticator device was lost or stolen.

You can remove your current 2FA device and add a new one for added security.

To remove a 2FA device:

1. Navigate to https://app.cobalt.io/settings/security/2fa.
1. Under **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, select **Manage**.
1. Locate the desired device, and select the trash icon.

Now you can add a new 2FA device to protect your account.

If you lose access to your authenticator, ask your Organization Owner to turn off 2FA or use your recovery code. For details, see [Lost Access to Your Authenticator](/platform-deep-dive/cobalt-account/account-recovery/#lost-access-to-your-authenticator).
