## Manage Security Settings

To manage two-factor authentication (2FA) settings for your account, select **Security Settings** on the user menu.

### Two-Factor Authentication

#### Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Even if your organization hasn't enforced 2FA for all users, we recommend that you enable it to enhance your account security. If you're using [SAML SSO](/getting-started/sign-in/#saml-sso) to sign in, you don't need to turn on 2FA.

![Configure 2FA for your account](/deepdive/SecuritySettings.png "Two-factor authentication page")

To enable 2FA on your account:

1. Navigate to https://app.cobalt.io/settings/security/2fa.
    - You should see **Disabled** under **Status**.
1. Enter your current password, and select **Enable two-factor authentication**.
    - {{% forgot-password-reset %}}
1. Scan the QR code using an authenticator app on your mobile device, such as [Authy](https://authy.com/) or [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447).
1. Enter a 6-character code that your authenticator app generates.
1. Select **Enable two-factor authentication** to confirm.

Now, each time you sign in to Cobalt, you need to enter a one-time code from your authenticator app. You can turn on the option to remember your device for 30 days.

For troubleshooting tips, see [Problems with Two-Factor Authentication](/platform-deep-dive/cobalt-account/account-recovery/#problems-with-two-factor-authentication).

#### Reset Two-Factor Authentication

We don't recommend turning off 2FA on your account. However, you may need to reset 2FA when:

- You want to switch to a different authenticator provider.
- You believe your [account was compromised](/platform-deep-dive/cobalt-account/account-recovery/#account-was-compromised)â€”and you still have access to your authenticator.
- You have a new device. Depending on your authenticator, you can transfer data to a new device without having to reset 2FA in Cobalt.
  - For Authy, [restore your access](https://support.authy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012672088-Restoring-Authy-Access-on-a-New-Lost-or-Inaccessible-Phone) on a new device.
  - For Google Authenticator, [transfer your codes](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&ref_topic=2954345#zippy=%2Ctransfer-google-authenticator-codes-to-new-phone) to a new device.

If you lose access to your authenticator, start the account recovery process, as described in [Lost Access to Your Authenticator](/platform-deep-dive/cobalt-account/account-recovery/#lost-access-to-your-authenticator).

To reset 2FA on your account:

1. Navigate to https://app.cobalt.io/settings/security/2fa.
1. Enter your current password, and select **Disable two-factor authentication**.
    - {{% forgot-password-reset %}}
1. To reactivate 2FA, follow the procedure described in [Enable Two-Factor Authentication](#enable-two-factor-authentication).
