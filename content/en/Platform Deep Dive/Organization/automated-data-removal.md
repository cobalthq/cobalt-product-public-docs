# Automated Data Removal

Once your contract has ended, a 30-day grace period will start in which you will still have access to the platform in case you wish to export any data from it. You will also receive a notification about this.
The grace period will be lifted in case of a contract renewal.
After the grace period, you won't be allowed access to the platform anymore. However, your data will remain in our system for 90 days (termination period) after the grace period has ended. You'll be able to extend the termination period for an additional 90 days, as long as this gets confirmed before the end of the period.

## Which data will be removed?
- User accounts (except those associated to additional organizations not affected by data removal)
- The organization's address, name and logo
- Assets
- Pentests
- Jira integrations

## Which user roles will receive email notifications before removal occurs?
- Owners and Customer Success Managers

## Which notifications will be sent?
- Data removal reminders: 60-30-7-1 days before the data removal date (90 days after churn),
  These will be linked to a page to optionally extend the removal period. You'll be able to extend the period only once.
- Data retention extension: You will receive an email if your retention period gets extended.
- Data removal confirmation: After your data got removed, we will send you an email confirming this.

## Which user roles can request a 90-day extension?
- Only owners will be able to request a 90-day extension

## Which user roles will receive email notification after the removal process is complete?
- Organization owners and their assigned Customer Success Manager will receive notifications.

- If you want your data to be removed earlier, please reach out to your CSM.
