{{% min-credits-report %}}. If you’ve set up a pentest with fewer credits, you’ll still have access to the non-report items listed in Pentest Expectations.

We do not create multiple pentest reports for large [assets](/getting-started/assets/). For example, if you want separate pentest reports for different APIs, set up different pentests for each API.
