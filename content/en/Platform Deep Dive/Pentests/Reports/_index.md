You can download a report for a pentest once we move it to the Remediation [state](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/). Report types and their [contents](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/report-contents/) differ for each [pentest type](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-types/).

To download a report as a PDF file:

1. On the pentest page, navigate to **Reports**.
1. For [Comprehensive Pentests](/getting-started/glossary/#comprehensive-pentest), select the report type.
