{{% pageinfo %}}
Our pentest reports include what you need to further secure your systems.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

We provide the following [types of pentest reports](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/#pentest-report-types):

<!-- Find the content of this variable in the layouts/shortcodes directory -->
{{% pentest-report-types %}}

The report type determines its contents. If you've purchased an appropriate
{{% ptaas-tier %}}, you can [customize](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/customize-report/) the contents of some reports.

We do not leave out any finding details from the Full Report + Finding Details report.

## Target

We include the [Pentest Target](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/pentest-target/), the location of
your asset.

## Test Period

We include the dates when we tested your asset.

## Test Performed By

We include a list of pentesters who analyzed your asset. Each pentester name includes a link
to their Cobalt profiles.

## Executive Summary

Our executive summary includes:

- A high-level summary of the tests we performed
- A table with the number of [findings](/getting-started/glossary/#finding) that we identified, categorized by different [severity levels](/severitylevels/)
- Highlights of any significant findings

## Scope of Work

The scope shown in the following subsections varies depending on the type of [asset](/getting-started/glossary/#asset).

### Target Description

The report includes information on the asset that we tested, along with the
[environment](/getting-started/glossary/#environment) you specified when planning the pentest:

{{% environment %}} 

### In-Scope Testing Methodologies

In this section, we get into more specifics on the tests that we performed. In general,
we test to standards such as:

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/)
- [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)

In this section we include a checklist of the tests that we performed on your assets. Depending
on your asset, it may also include manual and automated steps that we use with black box
and grammar-based fuzzing. For more information, see:

- [OWASP definition of Fuzzing](https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing)
- [A brief introduction to fuzzing and why it's an important tool for developers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-fuzzing-and-why-its-an-important-tool-for-developers/)

### Test Cases that Thwarted Exploitation Attempts

This section lists the tests that did _not_ find vulnerabilities
while testing your asset.

## Methodology

We list the basic methodologies that we used before, during, and after our tests.

### Pre-Engagement

- Scoping
- Customer
- Documentation
- Information
- Discovery

### Penetration Testing

- Tool-assisted assessment
- Manual assessment
- Exploitation
- Risk Analysis
- Reporting

### Post Engagement

- Prioritized remediation
- Best practice support
- Retesting

## Risk Factors

We use a modified version of the [OWASP Risk Rating Methodology](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology), based on their business impact and likelihood.
We measure each factor on a scale from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high).

## Severity Definitions

Based on [Risk Factors](#risk-factors), we assign a rating to each finding, using the
following equation:

```
risk = impact * likelihood
```

For more information, see our documentation on [Severity Levels](/severitylevels).

## Summary of Findings

When feasible, we include graphs that categorize vulnerabilities by:

- Type
- Severity

### Analysis

We include a short summary of each vulnerability. If you have a Full Report + Finding Details,
you can find more information about each vulnerability in the appendix on [Finding Details](#appendix-a---finding-details).

Where applicable, we also include a list of open ports and services.

### General Risk Profile

We include a color-coded chart based on impact and likelihood of each vulnerability.
<!-- I'd include an example, but what I see doesn't present well in the build -->

## Recommendations

We include recommendations for what you can do to [mitigate](/getting-started/glossary/#mitigate)
and [remediate](/getting-started/glossary/#remediate) each finding.

## Post-Test Remediation

In this section, we include the type, severity, and state of each finding, as well as whether
the finding has been resolved.

## Terms

This section includes a disclaimer.

## Appendix A - Finding Details

In this section, we go into details for each finding. Our descriptions include the following:
