You can modify what's included in your pentest reports. You cannot customize [Automated Reports](/getting-started/glossary/#automated-report) and [Attestation Letters](/getting-started/glossary/#attestation-letter).

In our application, we make pentest reports available when they're ready for 
[Remediation](/penteststates/), or when they're [Closed](/penteststates/). 
To find and customize what you see in a report, take the following steps:

1. Select **Pentests**, select the **State** list, and select **Remediation**.

1. Now select your pentest, and select the **Report** tab. You'll see report sections,
   along with the **Report** list that allows you to select from the [Pentest Report
   Types](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/#pentest-report-types) shown in the linked table.

   <!-- I think this is better without the screenshot   
   ![Different Pentest Report Types](/gsg/PentestReportTypes.png "You can select different Pentest Report Types.") -->

1. You can now customize the selected report type. Select **Customize**, and scroll to a
   report section.

   - You can start from any of the other report templates, except the Attestation Letter.

1. If you want to leave out a report section, select the eye icon next to the section title.
   As we report all findings, we do not allow you to leave out any finding details.

1. When you've finished customizing your report, scroll to the top of the page and select **Apply**. 

1. Now you can select **Download** to download your pentest report, as a PDF file, with the
   changes you configured.

Unless you've customized a report, you won't see a **Customized Report** option in the list of report types. If you repeat the process, you'll overwrite any existing Customized Report.
