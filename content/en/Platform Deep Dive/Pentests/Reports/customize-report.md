If allowed by your {{% ptaas-tier %}}, you can customize reports for [Comprehensive Pentests](/getting-started/glossary/#comprehensive-pentest).

We make pentest reports available when they're ready for 
[Remediation](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/), or when they're [Closed](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/).
To find and customize what you see in a report, take the following steps:

1. In the Cobalt app, select **Pentests**, and then select **Remediation** or **Closed** in the **State** list.
1. Select your Comprehensive Pentest, and select the **Report** tab. You'll see report sections,
   along with the **Report** list that allows you to select from the [pentest report
   types](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/#pentest-report-types).<br><br>
   ![Report list on the pentest page](/deepdive/PentestReportTypes.png "Select a report type for your pentest")
1. You can now customize the selected report type. Select **Customize**, and scroll to a
   report section.
1. If you want to leave out a report section, select the eye icon next to the section title.
    - You can't hide the [Executive Summary](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/report-contents/#executive-summary).
    - For an [Attestation Letter](/getting-started/glossary/#attestation-letter), section titles don't appear. You can only hide an overall findings summary table.<br><br>

1. When you've finished customizing your report, scroll to the top of the page, and select **Apply**.
1. Now you can select **Download** to download your pentest report, as a PDF file, with the
   changes you configured.

Unless you've customized a report, you won't see a **Customized Report** option in the list of report types. If you repeat the process, you'll overwrite any existing Customized Report.<br><br>
