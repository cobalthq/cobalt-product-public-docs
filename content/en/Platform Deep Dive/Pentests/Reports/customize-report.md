You can customize the following report types for [Comprehensive Pentests](/getting-started/glossary/#comprehensive-pentest):

- Customer Letter
- Attestation Report
- Full Report
- Full Report + Finding Details

You can't customize an [Attestation Letter](/getting-started/glossary/#attestation-letter) (for [Comprehensive Pentests](/getting-started/glossary/#comprehensive-pentest)) and [Automated Report](/getting-started/glossary/#automated-report) (for [Agile Pentests](/getting-started/glossary/#agile-pentest)).

In our application, we make pentest reports available when they're ready for 
[Remediation](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/), or when they're [Closed](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/).
To find and customize what you see in a report, take the following steps:

1. In the Cobalt app, select **Pentests**, select the **State** list, and select **Remediation**.
1. Select your Comprehensive Pentest, and select the **Report** tab. You'll see report sections,
   along with the **Report** list that allows you to select from the [pentest report
   types](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/#pentest-report-types).<br>
   ![Report list on the pentest page](/deepdive/PentestReportTypes.png "Select a report type for your pentest")
1. You can now customize the selected report type. Select **Customize**, and scroll to a
   report section.
   - You can start from any of the other report templates, except the Attestation Letter.
1. If you want to leave out a report section, select the eye icon next to the section title.
   As we report all findings, we do not allow you to leave out any finding details.<br>

1. When you've finished customizing your report, scroll to the top of the page and select **Apply**.
1. Now you can select **Download** to download your pentest report, as a PDF file, with the
   changes you configured.

Unless you've customized a report, you won't see a **Customized Report** option in the list of report types. If you repeat the process, you'll overwrite any existing Customized Report.
