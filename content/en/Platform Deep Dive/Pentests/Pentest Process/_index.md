| | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Discover** | Prepare for the pentest engagement.<ul><li>Map the attack surface of your software.</li><li>Create an account on the Cobalt platform following our invitation. Our CSM team will get in touch with you.</li></li>  |
| 2 | **Plan** | Plan, scope, and schedule your pentest.<ul><li>See our [Getting Started](/getting-started/) guide to learn how to launch a pentest. If you need help, [contact us](/getting-started/#get-in-touch).</li><li>Prepare the environment for our pentesters, such as set up test credentials for them.</li><li>Alert the stakeholders in your organization about the upcoming pentest.</li><li>Once you've submitted the pentest, we'll assign pentesters based on your technology stack.</li></ul> |
| 3 | **Test** | Pentesters test your asset using various [pentest methodologies](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/methodologies/) and techniques.<ul><li>Pentesters share vulnerabilities that they discover in real time, in [Slack](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/collaborate-on-pentests/#use-slack-for-communication) and in the Cobalt app. Learn more about [collaborating on a pentest](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/collaborate-on-pentests/).</li><li>At this stage, you can start [remediating findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/) that pentesters discover.</li><li>The standard testing period is 14 days. It may vary depending on the [pentest scope](/getting-started/planning/#scope-the-pentest) and other factors.</li></ul>|
| 4 | **Remediate** | The testing process is complete. Remediate [findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/) that pentesters discovered.<ul><li>You can [submit a finding for retest](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#submit-a-finding-for-retest) or [accept the risk](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#mark-a-finding-as-accepted-risk).</li><li><b>Retesting is included in the pentest program.</b> Learn more about the [free retesting duration](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#free-retesting-duration).</li><li>We recommend that you remediate findings promptly to minimize any potential security incidents that may arise from the identified vulnerabilities.</li><li>At this stage, the Pentest Lead works on the [pentest report](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/). For Agile Pentests, you get an Automated Report.</li><li>You can [configure integrations](/integrations/) to post findings to your preferred task management software.</li></ul> |
| 5 | **Report** | Download the [pentest report](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/) to view a summary of vulnerabilities in your software. Share the report with stakeholders.<ul><li>The report will be available 2 to 3 business days after the pentest is complete.</li><li>The [content](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/report-contents/) of the report differs depending on the report type.</li></ul> |
| 6 | **Analyze** | Once the pentest is complete, analyze the security posture of your asset.<ul><li>Deep dive into the pentest report to assess discovered vulnerabilities with your development and security teams.</li><li>Take the required remediation actions.</li><li>Identify what you expect from your next pentest for this asset.</li></ul> |
