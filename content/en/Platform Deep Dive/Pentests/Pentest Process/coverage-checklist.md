{{% pageinfo %}}
The **Cobalt coverage checklist** is a list of checks that pentesters use throughout a pentest to ensure that a baseline of security controls are in place. The list is based on the industry best practices.

The coverage checklist differs for each [asset type](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/).

- For Web, API, and Mobile assets, the list is based on the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Level 3](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_3.0.1.pdf).
- For other [pentest methodologies](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/methodologies/) that are not covered by OWASP, we defined a custom baseline based on the input from domain experts.

## How Pentesters Work with the Coverage Checklist

<span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">The coverage checklist is not intended to describe how to perform a pentest. Its purpose is to help coordinate the work of pentesters and to ensure the baseline coverage. Usually, the work of pentesters goes well beyond the coverage checklist.</span>

Pentesters use the coverage checklist **collaboratively** throughout a pentest.

- Once a pentester has completed a specific check, they mark this item as tested.
- Other pentesters see which items have been tested and which they need to work on.
- Multiple pentesters can cover the same security controls.

Pentesters can also associate [findings](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/) with ASVS categories.

## How to Use the Coverage Checklist

On the pentest page, navigate to the **Coverage** tab.

- Track the testing progress in real time, for each security category or for the entire pentest.
- Identify categories that have associated findings. Work on these security controls to minimize risks.
- Analyze which security controls have passed the test. If pentesters found vulnerabilities in these categories earlier, it means that you've successfully remediated the issues.
