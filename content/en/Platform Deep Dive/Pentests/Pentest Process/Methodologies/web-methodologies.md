Overview of test methodologies for Web assets. Includes microservices.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

We use the penetration testing objectives listed on this page. If you want to know more
about each methodology, navigate to the [Pentest Methodologies](..) page associated with your asset.

## Web

The Cobalt team of pentesters do not need access to the underlying web application source code,
unless you specify it as a requirement.

When you set up a pentest for a web asset in the UI, you'll see the following in the
Objectives text box:

```
Coverage of OWASP top 10, ASVS and application logic.
```

Learn more about these objectives from OWASP:

- [OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten)
- [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard)

We look at application logic by working with your app.

Tests of a Web asset include tests of APIs used to populate content on that asset. If you
have additional APIs, you may consider setting up:

- A combined Web + API test
- A separate test for APIs

We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OWASP Application Security
Verification Standard (ASVS) and Testing Guide. In support, we use a number of manual and automated
tools, described in the following steps, to ensure full coverage.

{{% expand "Target scope reconnaissance" %}}
</br>
Based on the Pentest Brief prepared by the client, Cobalt pentesters search for
information about the targets and investigate the scope. This information
includes:

- Web application URLs
- Descriptions of application logic
- Functions critical to the business

Pentesters then confirm that they can:

- Reach and scan the targets
- Test the functionality of the application

Our pentesters may use reconnaissance scanning tools such as:

- Recon-ng
- Dnscan
- Dirble
- Aquatone
- Masscan

{{% expand "Business and application logic mapping" %}}
</br>

Pentesters manually examine the target applications to map:

- Business functions
- Workflows
- Underlying processes

They also build a matrix of the access controls within the application based on
supported roles and actions. Our pentesters use this matrix to plan further security
tests, which determines:

- How well these controls are enforced
- How an attacker can bypass these controls

Our pentesters may use application logic analysis tools such as:

- Burp Suite Pro/Community
- Postman
- OWASP Zed Attack Proxy
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "Automated web crawling and web scanner configuration tweaking" %}}
</br>

Our pentesters use both commercial and freeware security tools to assess the targeted
application. They'll modify these tools as needed, to make sure that scanning can find
security issues on every segment of your asset, and the application as a whole.

In addition, our pentesters run automated crawls to:

- Identify any pages are available to unauthenticated users
- Determine the full site tree

Our pentesters may use web crawling and scanning tools such as:

- Nmap
- Burp Suite Pro/Community
- Nikto
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "Authenticated vulnerability scanning / Manual crawling" %}}
</br>

In this part of the pentest process, our pentesters:

- Use automated tools for web application crawling
  - Verify the results manually
- Run manual crawling tests for better coverage
  - Verify authentication on protected areas of the application

With automated scanning, our pentesters:

- Assess the application using the authenticated sessions where applicable

Our pentesters use extreme caution to minimize impact on the targeted system.
They may use vulnerability scanning tools such as:

- WPScan
- Burp Suite Pro/Community
- sqlmap

{{% expand "Manual web vulnerability tests / exploit reviews / microservices" %}}
</br>

Cobalt pentesters use tool-assisted manual tests to identify and analyze the
following parts of the app for vulnerabilities:

- Functionality
- Business logic
- Deployment

The assessment identifies published vulnerabilities, including those listed in the 

- OWASP Top 10
- CVE reports or tracked by CVE entries

Our pentesters also consider the workflows and business logic into consideration
when they identify vulnerabilities in the application.

The assessment includes tests for vulnerabilities such as:

- Injection attacks that probe the robustness of server-validation routines
- Session management flaws that could allow user impersonation
- Flaws in access control that expose data or enable users to gain elevated privileges

If the application includes microservices, our pentesters focus on interactions
between different systems. They examine the implementation of:

- Access control management
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

We thoroughly examine:

- Access control management
  - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implementation
- Vulnerabilities outlined in the OWASP [API Security Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/)

For each finding, pentesters determine the risk associated with each issue by:

- Demonstrating how the issue could be exploited
- Evaluating its impact within the context of the business function, data, and
  users of the asset
- Setting up a Proof-of-Concept exploitation to:
  - Demonstrate the presence of the vulnerability
  - Minimize potential adverse impact to the application, its data, and its underlying systems

Our pentesters use multiple testing and exploitation tools such as:

- Burp Suite Pro/Community
- OWASP ZAP
- Dirble
- Nuclei

{{% expand "Ongoing assessments" %}}
</br>

Our pentesters report their findings, in real time, through the Cobalt platform.
They also:

- Assess all risks
- Recommend steps for remediation

You're welcome to communicate with our pentesters for each of their findings.

{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "Report, triage, and retest" %}}
</br>

Our pentesters report and triage all vulnerabilities during the assessment. You
can review details of all findings, in real time, through the Cobalt platform.
In these findings, as well as in any report, our pentesters include detailed
information on how you can:

- Remediate each finding
- Improve your overall security posture

If you remediate findings during the supported pentest period, our pentesters
can retest your updated components against each discovered vulnerability.
