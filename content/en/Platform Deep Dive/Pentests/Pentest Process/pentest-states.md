From the moment you've started saving a draft of a pentest, we assign a label
for that pentest. We've set up these definitions as if you've set up the pentest
through our user interface. Here's the meaning of each label:

| Label       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Draft       | You've started the **Create a Pentest** process. However, you may not have added the information that we need to start work on your pentest.                                                                                              |
| In Review   | You've submitted the pentest. We're reviewing your submission. We may have questions for you.                                                                                                                |
| Planned     | We've accepted your proposed pentest. We'll assign pentesters based on your technology stacks and methodology. You should also have access to a Slack channel dedicated to your pentest.                                                                                             |
| Live        | We've started working on your pentest. Use the pentest chat channel to communicate directly with your pentesters. When we have questions and discover [findings](/getting-started/glossary/#finding), we'll share them in the channel.                                                                                           |
| Paused      | We're unable to continue the pentest. You should see a reason in the Slack channel associated with your pentest.                                                                                                                          |
| Remediation | We've completed and shared the results of our pentest, including our vulnerability findings. You can either accept or [remediate](/getting-started/glossary/#remediate) each vulnerability. Once complete, resubmit your request. We'll retest your asset.                    |
| Closed      | You may have accepted our findings. Or we've retested each of our findings, and cannot reproduce them. We may have not found any vulnerabilities, or you've accepted any vulnerabilities that we've found. |
| Cancelled   | If you no longer need a pentest, you're always welcome to cancel it. We'll keep the pentest in our records in case you change your mind.                                                                                                  |

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
Pentests remain in Remediation until you've addressed all findings. You can address each finding by either:

- Remediating the finding and [submitting it for retest](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#submit-a-finding-for-retest).
- [Accepting the finding](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#mark-a-finding-as-accepted-risk), and any associated security risk.
