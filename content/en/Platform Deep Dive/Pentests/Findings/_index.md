Once your pentest goes [Live](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/), our pentesters start testing your [asset](/platform-deep-dive/assets/). You get updates from pentesters in a dedicated Slack channel and in the **Pentester Updates** sidebar.

You can manage findings using the Cobalt API. Learn more in our [API documentation](https://docs.cobalt.io/v2/#findings).
