Once your pentest goes [Live](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/), pentesters start testing your [asset](/platform-deep-dive/assets/). You get updates from pentesters in a dedicated Slack channel and in the **Pentester Updates** sidebar.

You can manage findings using the Cobalt API. Learn more in our [API documentation](/cobalt-api/documentation/v2/#findings).

## Pentest View

To view findings reported on a specific pentest, on the pentest page, navigate to the **Findings** tab.

![View findings reported on a specific pentest](/deepdive/ViewFindingsSummary.png "View findings reported on a specific pentest")

Here, you can filter findings by:

- Finding [state](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/finding-states/)
- Finding [severity level](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/severity-levels/)
- Vulnerability type, from criteria such as the [OWASP Top 10 list](https://owasp.org/Top10/)
- Assignee, if pentesters or someone from your organization assigned the finding
- Label, if pentesters or someone from your organization applied a label

You can **download findings** in a CSV file based on applied filters.
