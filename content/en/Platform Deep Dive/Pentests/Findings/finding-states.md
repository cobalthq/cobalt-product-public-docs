We move the pentest to [Closed](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/) once youâ€™ve resolved all findings. Until then, the pentest is in Remediation.

You can filter findings by their state on the [**Findings** tab](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/) of the pentest page.

| Finding State | Description |
|---|---|
| **Triaging** | Potential vulnerability that pentesters triage and validate after posting.  |
| **Pending Fix** | Pentesters validated the finding and assigned a [severity level](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/severity-levels/) to it based on the likelihood of occurrence and business impact. You can now:<ul><li>Fix the finding and [submit it for retest](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#submit-a-finding-for-retest). If the issue persists after the retest, pentesters move the finding back to Pending Fix.</li><li>[Mark the finding as Accepted Risk](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#mark-a-finding-as-accepted-risk).</li></ul> |
| **Ready for Retest (Retest)** | You fixed the finding internally and [submitted it for retest](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#submit-a-finding-for-retest). Pentesters retest the finding and then change its state to:<ul><li>**Fixed**, if they can't reproduce the issue.</li><li>**Pending Fix**, if the issue persists. Read the pentester's comment for details.</li></ul> |
| **Resolved** | This includes three states:<ul><li>**Fixed**: After you [submitted the finding for retest](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#submit-a-finding-for-retest), pentesters verified that you fixed the issue internally. They couldn't reproduce the issue.</li><li>**Accepted Risk**: You [accepted the finding](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#mark-a-finding-as-accepted-risk) as a low risk.</li><li>**Carried Over**: Finding that you haven't fixed during the previous pentest for the same asset. When you launch a new pentest, we create a finding in the Carried Over state. In the previous pentest, the finding always appears as Carried Over even if you fixed it in the next pentest. This status does not apply to [In-House Pentests](/getting-started/glossary/#in-house-pentest).</li></ul> |

If you're an [In-House Pentester](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/user-roles/#in-house-pentester) who works on an [In-House Pentest](/getting-started/glossary/#in-house-pentest), you see additional statuses:

- **Draft**: You saved a finding as a draft.
- **Declined**: After triaging a finding, you decline it because it's not a vulnerability.
- **Out of Scope**: The vulnerability is out of scope for this pentest.
- **Duplicate**: The vulnerability already exists on the pentest.
