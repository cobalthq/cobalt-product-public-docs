We move the pentest to [Closed](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/) once youâ€™ve resolved all findings. Until then, the pentest is in Remediation.

You can filter findings by their state on the [**Findings** tab](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/) of the pentest page.

| Finding State | Description |
|---|---|
| Triaging | Potential vulnerability that our pentesters triage and validate after posting. |
| Pending Fix | Pentesters validated the finding and assigned a [severity level](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/severity-levels/) to it based on the likelihood of occurrence and business impact. You can now:<ul><li>Fix the finding and [submit it for retest](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#submit-a-finding-for-retest). If the issue persists after the retest, pentesters move the finding back to Pending Fix.</li><li>[Mark the finding as Accepted Risk](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#mark-a-finding-as-accepted-risk).</li></ul> |
| Ready for Retest (Retest) | You fixed the finding internally and [submitted it for retest](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#submit-a-finding-for-retest). Pentesters retest the finding and then change its state to:<ul><li>Fixed, if they can't reproduce the issue.</li><li>Pending Fix, if the issue persists. Read the pentester's comment for details.</li></ul> |
| Resolved | This includes three states:<ul><li>**Fixed**: After you [submitted the finding for retest](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#submit-a-finding-for-retest), our pentesters verified that you fixed the issue internally. They couldn't reproduce the issue.</li><li>**Accepted Risk**: You [accepted the finding](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/#mark-a-finding-as-accepted-risk) as a low risk.</li><li>**Carried Over**: Finding that you haven't fixed during the previous pentest for the same asset. When you launch a new pentest, we create a finding in the Carried Over state. In the previous pentest, the finding always appears as Carried Over even if you fixed it in the next pentest.</li></ul> |
