When our pentesters find vulnerabilities, they also identify severity
levels. This helps you understand the associated risk to the business.

The [OWASP Risk Rating Methodology](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) specifies High, Medium, and Low levels. We've added Critical and Informational levels to help you prioritize our findings.

We follow the standard risk model described by OWASP, where:

```
Risk = Likelihood * Impact
```

In this case, the risk rating is based on the following factors:

- **Likelihood**: Specifies the probability of exploiting the [finding](/getting-started/glossary/#finding).
May include factors such as:

  - Skill required for an attacker to exploit a [vulnerability](/getting-started/glossary/#vulnerability)
  - Availability of documented exploits
  - Ease of exploiting the vulnerability

- **Impact**: Depends on the effect on technical and business operations. May include:

  - Loss of confidentiality
  - Problems with data integrity
  - Reduced availability of data or systems
  - Potential losses of money or reputation

When our pentesters find vulnerabilities, they use the standard OWASP risk model
and then classify them into one of the following levels:

| Category | Score | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | 25 | Includes vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. |
| High | 16-24 | Impacts the security of your application/platform/hardware, including supported systems. Includes high probability vulnerabilities with a high business impact. |
| Medium | 5-15 | Includes vulnerabilities that are: medium risk, medium impact; low risk, high impact; high risk, low impact. |
| Low | 2-4 | Specifies common vulnerabilities with minimal impact.
| Informational | 1 | Notes vulnerabilities of minimal risk to your business. |

Once our pentesters assign a severity level, we move the finding to **Pending Fix**, as described in our [Finding States](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/finding-states/).
