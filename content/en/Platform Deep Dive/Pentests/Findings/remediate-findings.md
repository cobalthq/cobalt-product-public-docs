During remediation, review findings that pentesters discovered, and take action on them.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Once pentesters move a finding to [Pending Fix](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/finding-states/), you can:

- Fix the finding and [submit it for retest](#submit-a-finding-for-retest)
- [Mark the finding as Accepted Risk](#mark-a-finding-as-accepted-risk)

Pentesters describe findings and provide recommendations on how to fix them. Navigate to the finding page for details.

## Submit a Finding for Retest

Once you've fixed a finding internally, you can submit it for retest.

1. On the **Findings** tab of the pentest page, filter **Pending Fix** findings.<br><br>
![Filter Pending Fix findings](/deepdive/FilterPendingFixFindings.png "Filter Pending Fix findings")
1. Select the desired finding.
1. In the **State** list, select **Ready for Retest**.<br><br>
![Submit a finding for retest](/deepdive/ReadyForRetestFinding.png "Submit a finding for retest")
1. (Optional) Leave a comment for pentesters. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, enter your comment, and select **Comment** to confirm.

The pentester who posted the finding gets notified and retests the issue. When finished, they change the [finding state](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/finding-states/) to:

- Fixed, if they can't reproduce the issue.
- Pending Fix, if the issue persists. Read the pentester's comment for details.

For Agile and Comprehensive Pentests that Cobalt pentesters perform, you can submit findings for retest at any time:

- Until the end of the [free retesting](#free-retesting-duration) period; or
- 10 days before your contract ends.

Cobalt pentesters complete retesting within seven (7) business days after submission.

### Free Retesting Duration

For Agile and Comprehensive Pentests that Cobalt pentesters perform, the timeline for retesting starts after your pentest end date within an active contract. Mark your findings as **Ready for Retest** at least 10 days before your contract ends.

- Free retesting is based on your {{% ptaas-tier %}}:
  - Standard tier: 6 months
  - Premium and Enterprise tiers: 12 months
- Free retesting is only available within an active contract. Your retest end date is either the duration of your purchased tier or 10 days before your contract end date (until 23:59 UTC).
- When you start a pentest right before your contract expires, you may not qualify for retesting. If you add a new contract, we'll update your retest end date based on the tier your pentest was planned in.

{{%expand "See an example." %}}
The Standard contract duration is from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.

You have a pentest moved to Planned on December 18, 2022 with a start date of December 20, 2022 and an end date of January 3, 2023. The free retesting end date for this pentest is December 21, 2022, until 23:59 UTC (10 days before your current contract end date).

Then on December 30, 2022, you signed a new Enterprise contract for a period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. To recalculate the free retesting end date for your pentest planned on December 18, we'll look at the Standard tier. Since you extended your contract, we'll also update your retesting end date from January 3, 2023 23:59 UTC to June 3, 2023 23:59 UTC (6 months for Standard tier).

## Mark a Finding as Accepted Risk

{{% accepted-risk-intro %}}

If you think a finding is not a vulnerability, ask pentesters to reevaluate it. On the finding page, leave a comment explaining this. For [Comprehensive Pentests](/getting-started/glossary/#comprehensive-pentest), tag a [Pentest Lead](/getting-started/glossary/#pentest-lead). Leave the finding in the [Pending Fix](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/finding-states/) state until it's resolved.

- If pentesters confirm that the finding is not a vulnerability after reevaluating it, they decline the finding.
- If pentesters still consider the vulnerability a real finding, you can mark it as Accepted Risk.

To mark a finding as Accepted Risk:

1. On the **Findings** tab of the pentest page, filter **Pending Fix** findings.<br><br>
![Filter Pending Fix findings](/deepdive/FilterPendingFixFindings.png "Filter Pending Fix findings")
1. Select the desired finding.
1. In the **State** list, select **Accepted Risk**.<br><br>
![Mark a finding as Accepted Risk](/deepdive/AcceptedRiskFinding.png "Mark a finding as Accepted Risk")
1. In the overlay that appears, select a reason for accepting the risk or specify your own. You can add a note to provide more details.<br><br>
![Select a reason for accepting a finding](/deepdive/AcceptedRiskReason.png "Select a reason for accepting a finding")
1. Select **Submit** to confirm.
   - Users who have access to the pentest can see who accepted the risk and view all related details. If needed, they can edit the reason and note.<br><br>
   ![Edit a reason for accepting a finding](/deepdive/EditAcceptedRisk.png "Edit a reason for accepting a finding")

On the [pentest report](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/), in the [Post-Test Remediation](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/report-contents/#post-test-remediation) section, the finding appears as Accepted Risk. You can see details under **Accepted Risk Reasons**. This information may be relevant to stakeholders you share the report with.
