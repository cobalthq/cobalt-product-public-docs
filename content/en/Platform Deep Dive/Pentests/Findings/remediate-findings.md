During remediation, review findings that our pentesters discovered, and take action on them.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Once our pentesters move a finding to [Pending Fix](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/finding-states/), you can:

- Fix the finding and [submit it for retest](#submit-a-finding-for-retest)
- [Mark the finding as Accepted Risk](#mark-a-finding-as-accepted-risk)

Our pentesters describe findings and provide recommendations on how to fix them. Navigate to the finding page for details.

## Submit a Finding for Retest

Once you've fixed a finding internally, you can submit it for retest.

1. On the **Findings** tab of the pentest page, filter **Pending Fix** findings.<br><br>
![Filter Pending Fix findings](/deepdive/FilterPendingFixFindings.png "Filter Pending Fix findings")
1. Select the desired finding.
1. In the **State** list, select **Ready for Retest**.<br><br>
![Submit a finding for retest](/deepdive/ReadyForRetestFinding.png "Submit a finding for retest")

The pentester who posted the finding gets notified and retests the issue. When finished, they change the [state](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/finding-states/) to:

- Fixed, if they can't reproduce the issue.
- Pending Fix, if the issue persists. Read the pentester's comment for details.
