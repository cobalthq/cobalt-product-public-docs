## Introducing the Pentest Management Platform

The Cobalt Pentest Management Platform is designed to increase the efficiency and quality of your internal pentests. With this solution, security teams can:

- Manage internal pentests in one place
- Streamline end-to-end processes
- Standardize reporting for stakeholders

An Internal Pentest is a pentest that your organization's team members complete for your organization on the Cobalt platform without involving Cobalt pentesters.

The workflow for Internal Pentests is similar to other pentests that you run on the Cobalt platform. Here's what you need to know:

- Internal Pentests will not impact your [credit balance](/platform-deep-dive/credits/track-credits/). You can launch as many Internal Pentests as you need.
- Cobalt [pentesters](/getting-started/glossary/#pentester) are not involved in the testing process.
- You define the testing period. We don’t set limitations on the start date or testing duration.
- As with other pentests, Cobalt Staff may have access to your pentests and findings.
  - You can keep track of who has, and has previously had, access to your organization on the **People** page. To view who has or had access to specific pentests, navigate to the **Collaborators** tab.
  - We do our best to keep your data safe. Learn more about our [security practices](https://www.cobalt.io/security/practices).

## Set Up an Internal Pentest

As an [Organization Owner](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-owner) or [Member](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-member), you can set up an Internal Pentest—following the same steps as for other [pentest types](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-types/). Some parameters in the pentest wizard may slightly differ for Internal Pentests.

To launch an Internal Pentest:

1. [Define your assets](/getting-started/assets/).
    - You can run Internal Pentests on assets that you’ve already tested on the Cobalt platform.
1. On the **Pentests** page, select **Create a Pentest**.
1. Under **Internal Pentest**, [select or create an asset](/getting-started/select-pentest-type/#select-or-create-an-asset) that you want to test, and then select **Continue**.<br><br>
![Select or create an asset to start setting up an Internal Pentest](/deepdive/PentestTypesInternalPentest.png "Select or create an asset to start setting up an Internal Pentest")
1. [Review your asset](/getting-started/review-asset/).
1. Set [requirements](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/) for your pentest.
1. Define the [details](/getting-started/details/) of your environment.
1. [Schedule the pentest](/getting-started/planning/#schedule-the-pentest) by setting your desired start and end date.
    - The start date and testing period are flexible.
1. [Review your pentest](/getting-started/review-pentest/) to make sure you’ve included all information that your pentesters need. When ready, select **Complete Review**. Your pentest is now Planned.
1. Invite Internal Pentesters to the pentest. Select the <i style="font-size:x-large; color: #0047AB" class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> key for instructions.
   {{%expand "To invite an Internal Pentester:" %}}
   1. On the pentest page, select **Settings** > **Collaborators**.
   1. Enter the user's email address, select the arrow next to **Add Team Member**, and then select **Internal Pentester**. Select **Add Internal Pentester** to confirm.<br><br>
   ![Add an Internal Pentester to your pentest](/deepdive/AddInternalPentester.png "Add an Internal Pentester to your pentest")<br><br>
      The user gets an email invite to work on the pentest. An Internal Pentester role has the same privileges as a [Pentest Team Member](/getting-started/glossary/#pentest-team-member), with additional access to pentester functionality.
      - To add more Internal Pentesters, follow the steps listed above. You can add one user at a time.
      - If a user is already a Pentest Team Member on the pentest, you can change their role to Internal Pentester.<br><br>
      ![Switch a user's role to Internal Pentester](/deepdive/SwitchRoleInternalPentester.png "Switch a user's role to Internal Pentester")<br>
      - You can also [add collaborators](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/organization/manage-users/#add-a-pentest-team-member) to the pentest.
   {{% /expand%}}
1. When ready, select **Launch Pentest**. Your pentest goes Live.

Once your pentest is Live, your Internal Pentesters can start testing your asset. You can track the progress in real time.

To collaborate on the pentest, navigate to the **Messages** tab. To read updates from pentesters, select **Pentester Updates**.

## Complete a Pentest as an Internal Pentester

As an Internal Pentester, you can perform pentests for your organization on the Cobalt platform. Once you've received an email invite to work on a pentest, follow the link in the email to get started.

When you sign in to Cobalt as an Internal Pentester, you land on the **Pentests** page showing pentests to which you're assigned.

![Pentests page that you land on as an Internal Pentester upon signing in](/deepdive/PentestsPagePentester.png "Pentests page that you land on as an Internal Pentester upon signing in")

Navigate to the pentest you plan to work on. On the pentest page, you can:

- Review the pentest scope and asset details.
- [Submit findings](#submit-findings) that you discover.
- Update the [coverage checklist](#update-the-coverage-checklist) as you progress through the pentest.
- Use [testing tools](#use-testing-tools) to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Write a [pentest report](#write-a-pentest-report).
- Communicate with other Internal Pentesters. Select **Team Updates** to open the chat.
- Collaborate with your organization members on the **Messages** tab.

### Submit Findings

A [finding](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/) is a potential security flaw in an app or physical hardware.
To report a vulnerability that you discovered:

1. On the pentest page, select **New Vulnerability**.<br><br>
![Submit a new finding from the pentest page](/deepdive/SubmitFinding.png "Submit a new finding from the pentest page")
1. Add details about the finding. Make sure to provide thorough information about the vulnerability to help your organization fix it.
    - Enter a title for the vulnerability.
    - Select the vulnerability type from the list. We've categorized and listed the most common vulnerability types. Start typing in the input field, and select one of the predefined options.
    - Select the ASVS category.
    - Review and edit the vulnerability description that populates in the **Description** field. We're providing boilerplate descriptions to help you speed up the documentation process.
    - Fill in other fields with detailed information.
1. Once you're done, you can:
    - Save the finding as a draft and go back to it later.
    - Submit the finding by selecting **Submit for Triaging**. Make sure to validate the finding before proceeding.
1. To assign a severity level to the finding, select **Pending Fix** from the **State** list.
    - Assign the likelihood and business impact to the finding. The severity level is calculated based on these parameters. To learn more, visit [Severity Levels](/pentests/findings/severity-levels/).
    - Assign the quality level. We use this parameter to track the report quality.
    - Select **Submit evaluation** to confirm.

Your team gets notified and can start [remediating the finding](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/).

### Update the Coverage Checklist

Navigate to the **Coverage** tab. As you go through the pentest scope, you can select specific items in the checklist to mark them as complete.

The checklist is based on the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) and is specific to the [asset type](/platform-deep-dive/assets/#asset-types) you're testing.

![Pentests page that you land on as an Internal Pentester upon signing in](/deepdive/CoverageChecklistPentester.png "Pentests page that you land on as an Internal Pentester upon signing in")

### Use Testing Tools

To save time throughout the pentest, use testing tools available on the Cobalt platform.

The Vulnerability Detector is a vulnerability scanner tool powered by Nuclei. It scans assets for potential vulnerabilities using Nuclei templates.

{{%expand "Expand to learn more." %}}

To scan an asset for potential vulnerabilities:

1. On the pentest page, navigate to the **Asset** tab.
1. Under **Vulnerability Detector**, select **New Scan**.<br><br>
![Start a new scan using the Vulnerability Detector](/deepdive/VulnerabilityDetectorStartNewScan.png "Start a new scan using the Vulnerability Detector")
1. Follow the instructions in the UI to add URLs that you want to scan, and then select **Start Scan**.
1. Once the scan is complete, you get a notification in Slack. Refresh the page to view positive scan results. They're only visible to Internal Pentesters who are not organization users.
1. Review each potential vulnerability. Decide whether you want to discard it or create a finding.
1. Follow the steps to [submit a finding](#submit-findings) to complete the process.

### Write a Pentest Report

To summarize the pentest, write a report.

1. On the pentest page, navigate to the **Report** tab, and select **Edit Report**.
1. Complete each section of the report. Some fields already contain boilerplate information. Learn more about the [report contents](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/report-contents/).
1. When you're done, change the report state to Final, and select **Submit for Review**.
    - To save your work and keep editing later, select **Save**.

All users who have access to the pentest can view and download the report.

### Finalize the Pentest

The pentest automatically moves to [Remediation](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/) when:

- No findings are in the New or Triaging state; and
- The pentest report is marked as Final.

The pentest state changes to [Closed](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/) when all findings are fixed.
