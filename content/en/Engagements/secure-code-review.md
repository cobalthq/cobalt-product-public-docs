## Secure Code Review

A Secure Code Review is the human-led examination of software’s source code in order to identify security vulnerabilities that are the result of design flaws, but proven to be valid security issues. It is an important part of any organization's software development life cycle (SDLC) and helps improve the overall quality and security of the software and an organization's overall security posture.

Secure code reviews are a specialized type of engagement that is not included in our standard penetration testing as a service (PtaaS)  offering. This service is delivered by our Cybersecurity Services team.
