We use the penetration testing methodologies listed on the page. If you want to know more
about each methodology, navigate to the section(s) associated with your asset(s).

## Mobile

The Cobalt team of pentesters do not need access to the underlying web application source code,
unless you specify it as a requirement.

We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OWASP Application Security
Verification Standard (ASVS) and Testing Guide. Our team takes the following steps to ensure
full coverage:

- Reconnaissance
  - Share the mobile application files
    - Android: .apk
    - iOS: .ipa
- Automated and Manual Testing
- Exploit Discovered Vulnerabilities
- Report, triage, and retest
  - Requires tests of at least two (2) credits
