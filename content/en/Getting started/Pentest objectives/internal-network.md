Overview of test methodologies for Internal networks.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

We use the penetration testing methodologies listed on the page, based in large part on the
[OSSTMM](../glossary#open-source-security-testing-methodology-manual-osstmm).

## Special Pentester Needs

Our pentests of internal networks are all performed remotely. To support this access, our
pentesters need:

- Access to your internal network through a stable VPN.
- A lightweight Linux server inside the network, used as a [jump box](../glossary#jump-box).
  - If you use AWS for your internal network, you can use
    [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fznsw3f7mq7to) to set up a virtual machine.
  - Alternatively, you can download a [Kali VM Image](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/).
  - You'll need to set up [key-based SSH access]() for each pentester.

## Internal Networks

The Cobalt team of pentesters can proceed with a minimum of information, such as the IP addresses
in question. However, you can include the following details in the scope of your desired pentest:

- Network diagrams
- Infrastructure diagrams
- Accounts (even temporary accounts for pentests)
- User information

We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OSSTMM standard for
penetration testing.

- Reconnaissance
  - Corporate website
  - Related websites, databases
  - DNS
  - Public records (such as WHOIS information)
- Service Discovery
  - Port scans on specific IP ranges
  - Focus on public-facing services
  - Follow-up with further tests
- Vulnerability scans
  - Test for penetration of the internal network
- Manual assessment
  - Public-facing services (Web, FTP, Email, Firewalls, Routers, DNS, VPNs, and more)
  - Access control systems such as Microsoft Active Directory
  - Less secure Email protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)
  - Printers
- Report, triage, and retest
  - Requires tests of at least two (2) credits
