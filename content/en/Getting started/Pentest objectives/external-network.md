We use the penetration testing methodologies listed on the page. If you want to know more
about each methodology, navigate to the section(s) associated with your asset(s).

## External Networks

The Cobalt team of pentesters can proceed with a minimum of information, such as the IP addresses
in question. However, you can include the following details in the scope of your desired pentest:

- Network diagrams
- Infrastructure diagrams
- Accounts (even temporary accounts for pentests)
- User information

We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OSSTMM standard for
penetration testing.

- Reconnaissance
  - Corporate website
  - Related websites, databases
  - DNS
  - Public records (such as WHOIS information)
- Service Discovery
  - Port scans on specific IP ranges
  - Focus on public-facing services
  - Follow-up with further tests
- Vulnerability scans
  - Test for penetration of the internal network
- Manual assessment
  - Public-facing services (Web, FTP, Email, Firewalls, Routers, DNS, VPNs, and more)
- Report, triage, and retest
  - Requires tests of at least two (2) credits
