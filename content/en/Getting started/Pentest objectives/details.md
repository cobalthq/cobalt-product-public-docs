Some detail requirements vary by the type of asset.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Our pentests have common requirements for all assets, as well as requirements for
specific assets. 

Pentest requirements for Web and API assets are identical. However, 
tests of a Web asset include tests of APIs used to populate content on that asset.

The Details page of the pentest wizard requests information about:

- The target environment
- For cloud providers, whether authorization is needed

## Common Pentest Requirements

All of our pentests share the characteristics listed in this section:

### Network Information

Our pentesters send requests from one or more of the following IP addresses:

- 35.185.178.3
- 35.198.53.81
- 104.198.99.165
- 104.199.55.175

### Environment

We need to know the environment of the pentest asset. The standard options are:

- Production (Serves end-users)
- Staging (Proposed future production environment)
- Development (App in work; may not be fully tested)

If you define your environment differently, let us know. In the UI, you can do so
in comments.

### Controls

If you've set up regulated access to your systems, we need to know. For example,
many organizations set up firewalls that limit access to specified traffic to
reduce the risk of Denial-of-Service attacks.

You could use systems like:

- Web-Application Firewalls (WAF)
- IP-based restrictions using allowlists/denylists, or services like `iptables`.

![Rate Controls](/RateControls.png "Describe the environment that you want tested.")

If you do have rate controls, include details. For example, you might include
details similar to:

- Limit `ping` messages (ICMP) to 2/second

### Cloud Platform Components

You don't need 

### Test Data

We need to know about the environment being tested, whether production data
is avaialble on the test system.

Our pentesters also need information on test data. If your apps contain:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Credit-card holder data (CHD)

Our pentesters will take extra care to protect that information.
<!-- Is this true? -->

Some apps support the use of credit cards for purchases. If you provide
test credit card numbers, you can share that information in the 
instructions [provide link] or in the "Kickoff call".
