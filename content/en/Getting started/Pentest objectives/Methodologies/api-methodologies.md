Overview of test methodologies for API assets. Includes microservices.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

We use the penetration testing methodologies listed on the page. If you want to know more
about each methodology, navigate to the page associated with your asset.

## API

The Cobalt team of pentesters do not need access to the underlying web application source code,
unless you specify it as a requirement.

When you set up a pentest for an API asset in the UI, you'll see the following in the
Objectives text box:

```
Coverage of OWASP top 10, ASVS and application logic.
```

Learn more about these objectives from OWASP:

- [OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security)
- [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard)

We look at application logic by working with your app.

We base our methodology primarily on the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
and Testing Guide. Our team takes the following steps to ensure full coverage:

- Target scope reconnaissance
- Business and application logic mapping
- Automated web crawling and web scanner configuration tweaking
- Authenticated vulnerability scanning
  - Manual crawling to ensure better coverage
- Manual API vulnerability tests and exploit reviews
  - Also covers microservices
- Ongoing assessments
  - Report results to clients through the platform
- Report, triage, and retest
