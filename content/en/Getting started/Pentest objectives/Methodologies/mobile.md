Overview of test methodologies for mobile assets.

We use the penetration testing objectives listed on this page. If you want to know more
about each methodology, navigate to the [Pentest Methodologies](..) page associated with your asset.

## Mobile

The Cobalt team of pentesters do not need access to the underlying mobile application source code,
unless you specify it as a requirement.

When you set up a pentest for a mobile asset in the UI, you'll see the following in the
Objectives text box:

```
Coverage of OWASP top 10, ASVS and application logic.
```

Learn more about these objectives from OWASP:

- [OWASP Mobile Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10)
- [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard)

We look at application logic by working with your app.

We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OWASP Application Security
Verification Standard (ASVS) and Testing Guide. Our team takes the following steps to ensure
full coverage:

- Reconnaissance
  - Share the mobile application files
    - Android: .apk
    - iOS: .ipa
- Automated and Manual Testing
- Exploit Discovered Vulnerabilities
- Report, triage, and retest
