Define what you want our pentesters to test.

When you set up a pentest through the UI, you're:

- Define the Asset
- Set up Pentest Objectives
- Add Details
- Plan the Pentest

This section can help you set up pentest objectives. In the Cobalt UI, you can
define pentest objectives in the following screen:

![Pentest Objectives](/PentestObjectives.png "Define objectives for your desired pentest.") 

On this page of the UI, you can:

- Specify a [target](./pentest-target).
- Define a [methodology](./pentest-methodologies), accept or modify detail objectives.
- Include [Test Credentials](./test-credentials).
- Add special [Instructions](./pentest-instructions).
- Define the [Technology Stack](./tech-stack).

If you're not sure what to include, follow the links. If you're experienced with defining
pentests, fill out the page, and continue to [Pentest Detail Requirements](../details).

We use the penetration testing methodologies listed on the page. If you want to know more
about each methodology, navigate to the section(s) associated with your asset(s).

## Web

The Cobalt team of pentesters do not need access to the underlying web application source code,
unless you specify it as a requirement.

We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OWASP Application Security
Verification Standard (ASVS) and Testing Guide. Our team takes the following steps to ensure
full coverage:

- Target scope reconnaissance
- Business and application logic mapping
- Automated web crawling and web scanner configuration tweaking
- Automated vulnerability scanning
  - Manual crawling to ensure better coverage
- Manual web vulnerability tests and exploit reviews
  - Also covers microservices 
- Ongoing assessments
  - Report results to clients through the platform
- Report, triage, and retest
  - Requires tests of at least two (2) credits

## Methodology

In general, this should be fixed. For example, if your asset type is API (only) the
methodology should be fixed as API.

If your asset includes 


### Web

When building a web application, you may use one or more of the following programming languages:

- Java
- JavaScript framework <!-- source: https://hackr.io/blog/best-javascript-frameworks -->
  - Angular
  - React
  - Node
  - Vue
- Go
- .NET
- PHP
- Python   
- Ruby

These are some of the more common examples. If your web application is built with a different
language(s), list them. Your pentester needs to know.

In addition, dynamic web sites may pull information from databases. You want a pentester whose
familiar with the weaknesses of languages such as:

- SQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Oracle
  - MySQL
  - MSSQL
- noSQL
- CockroachDB
- MongoDB

### Mobile

For some, mobile apps are an extension of web apps. If you have a dedicated mobile app, your
pentester needs to know what language was used to develop that app. 

In many cases, you may have used one of the [Web](#web) app languages. You may have also used
one of the languages that are designed for mobile apps, including:

- Swift
- Objective C
- Kotlin
- Dart

### API

An API, short for an Application Programming Interface, specifies how apps communicate with
each other. Most APIs are associated with one of the following three technologies:

- RESTful APIs
- GraphQL
- Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) <!-- Do we even support testing in SOAP? --> 

The technology drives the commands used to access data. And API testing also depends on
the programming language used to set it up. In general, you may use one or more of the
same programming languages used to create [Web](#web) or [Mobile](#mobile) apps.

### Internal Network / External Network

The technologies associated with internal and external networks relate mostly to hardware
components, including:

- Routers
- Switches
- Firewalls
- Load Balancers
- Proxy Servers

If you're looking for a test of an internal or an external network, it's also helpful to
include:

- A hardware diagram which depicts connections on your network

You can add this information to your asset, as described in
[Plan Your Assets](../#plan-your-assets).

### Cloud Configuration

We can help users test their cloud configurations by service. In general, cloud configuration
services correspond to services that may be installed on internal servers. But the key element
here is the Technology Stack.

In this case, cloud configuration technology stacks correspond to the services that you might
purchase from a cloud provider such as Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. To help you list the
right cloud configuration technology stack, we provide this list of examples:

- APIs
- VPNs
- S3 Guckets
- Databases (SQL, RDMS)
- Remote Desktops
- Virtual Machines

## Objective(s)

We have a set of standard objectives for each methodology. They include one or more of the following:

- Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual
  - [PDF](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf), 213 pages
  - Describes a process to prevent opponents from accessing sensitive information.
    Commonly used by government and military agencies. Focused on
    [OpSec](../glossary#operational-security-opsec).
- OWASP [Top 10 Web Application Security Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
  - Subject to change.
- OWASP [API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/)
<!-- Need confirmation, as this varies from what's shown in the UI -->
  - Subject to change.
- OWASP [Mobile Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/)
<!-- Need confirmation, as this varies from what's shown in the UI -->
  - Subject to change.
- OWASP [Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
- [Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM 3)](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf)
  - 200 page PDF
- [CIS Controls from the Center for Internet Security, version 8](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8/)
  - Formerly known as the SANS Top 20.


These tests do _not_ require access to the web application source code.

- Application logic based on business functionality
  - Includes testing of access controls based on roles and supported actions

If you haven't done so already, include the application logic in the asset description discussed
in [Plan Your Assets](../plan-assets).
