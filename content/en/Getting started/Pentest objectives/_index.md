When you set up a pentest through the UI, you:

- Define the Asset
- Create Pentest Objectives
- Add Details
- Plan the Pentest

This section can help you set up pentest objectives. In the Cobalt UI, you can
define pentest objectives in the following screen:

![Pentest Objectives](/PentestObjectives.png "Define objectives for your desired pentest.") 

On this page of the UI, you can:

- Specify a [Pentest Target](./pentest-target).
- Define a [Pentest Methodology](./methodologies), with detailed objectives.
- Include [Test Credentials](./test-credentials).
- Add special [Instructions](./special-instructions).
- Define the [Technology Stack](./stack).

If you're not sure what to include in the UI, follow the links associated with each
bullet. If you're experienced with defining pentests, fill out the page, and continue
to [Pentest Detail Requirements](../details).

We use the penetration testing methodologies listed on the page. If you want to know more
about each methodology, navigate to the section(s) associated with your asset(s).

If you start at the top of the pentest objectives page, your next step is to specify a [target](./pentest-target).
