This section can help you set pentest requirements. In the Cobalt UI, you can
define pentest requirements in the following screen:

![Pentest Requirements](/gsg/SetRequirements.png "Define requirements for your desired pentest")

On this page of the UI, you can:

- Specify a [Pentest Target](./pentest-target).
- Define a [Pentest Methodology](./methodologies), with detailed objectives. You can
  read about the objectives associated with each [asset](../glossary#asset) type.
- Include [Test Credentials](./test-credentials).
- Add special [Instructions](./special-instructions).
- Define the [Technology Stack](./stack).

If you're not sure what to include in the UI, follow the links associated with each
bullet. If you're experienced with defining pentests, fill out the page, and continue
to [Pentest Detail Requirements](../details).

We use the penetration testing methodologies listed on the page. If you want to know more
about each methodology, navigate to the page associated with your asset.

If you start at the top of the pentest requirements page, your next step is to specify a [target](./pentest-target).
