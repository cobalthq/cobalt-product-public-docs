Overview of test methodologies for your cloud setup.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

We support penetration testing of systems in the following cloud environments:

- Amazon AWS
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure

While we perform many of the same tests on different cloud configurations, each environment
has unique testing requirements.

## Common Requirements

Cobalt assesses your selected cloud environment, as well as all internal and external components. Cobalt
follows an industry standard methodology primarily based on:

- Best practices established by your cloud provider
- OWASP standards for Cloud Providers and [ASVS](../glossary#application-security-verification-standard-asvs).

The Cobalt team of pentesters do not need access to the underlying web application source code,
unless you specify it as a requirement.

We follow an industry standard methodology primarily based on the OWASP Application Security
Verification Standard (ASVS) and Testing Guide. Our team takes the following steps to ensure
full coverage:

- Target scope reconnaissance
- Component enumeration
  - Based on automated component discovery
- Automated component configuration assessment
  - Detail risks, based on Center for Internet Security (CIS) best practices
- Automated / manual review of externally exposed services
  - Basic vulnerability assessments
- Architectural design analysis
- Report, triage, and retest
  - Requires tests of at least two (2) credits

## Amazon AWS

Our pentesters need access to test your AWS systems. To that end, you should prepare:

- A dedicated AWS account for each pentester, with access to each target system.
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM) API credentials for each affected AWS account.
    - Include the following managed policies for the pentest user or role:
      - `SecurityAudit`
      - `ViewOnlyAccess`

These are the required policy Amazon Resource Names (ARN):

```
arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit
arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess
```

You should also include the architecture of your cloud configuration.

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Our pentesters need access to test your GCP systems. To that end, you should prepare:

- A dedicated GCP account for each pentester, with access to each target system.
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM) API credentials for each affected GCP account.
    - To provide API credentials, use a (service) account with Viewer and Security Reviewer
      permissions.

## Microsoft Azure

Our pentesters need access to test your Azure systems. To that end, you should prepare:
- A dedicated Azure account for each pentester, with access to each target system.
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM) API credentials for each dedicated account.

## Other Cloud Providers

We've done pentests on other cloud providers. You can refer to the
[Common Requirements](#common-requirements) listed earlier.

Cloud providers may require notification before we perform a pentest. For
more information, consult the documentation for your cloud provider.
