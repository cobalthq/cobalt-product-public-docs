Our pentesters follow specific methodologies for different types of assets.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

By default, our pentesters test for industry standard vulunerabilities from:

- [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/).
  - Includes different "Top 10" lists for web, API, mobile, and cloud systems.
- [Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) (PDF).
  - Used for internal and external networks.

For more information on how we pentest, refer to the detailed pages associated with your
asset.

- [Web](../web-methodologies)
- [API](../api-methodologies)
- [Mobile](../mobile)
- [Internal Network](../internal-network)
- [External Network](../external-network)
- [Cloud](../cloud)

In most cases, the Methodology is fixed, based on the [Asset Type](../../assets/asset-type/)
you defined earlier. However, if you selected a combined asset type, such as Web + API, you
can limit the test to either of the individual methodologies:

Review the methodology for your asset, from the links shown earlier. Each methodology
includes default requirements based on standards such as
[OWASP](../../glossary#open-web-application-security-project-owasp) and
[OSSTMM](../../glossary#open-soruce-security-testing-methodology-manual-osstmm).
You're welcome to include additional requirements.

Next, you'll want to set up and share [Test Credentials](../test-credentials/) for your
pentesters.
