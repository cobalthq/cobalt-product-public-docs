Now you can set a date for the pentest.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

By default, we support pentests:

- That start 48 hours after you select "Submit for Review".
- An end date 2 weeks after it starts.

On the Pentest Planning screen, you can also update the asset scope, and
therefore the number of credits required for the test.
