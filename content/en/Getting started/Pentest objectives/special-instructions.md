![Special Instructions](/SpecialInstructions.png "Special Instructions for your pentest")

You've already shared [details about your asset](../../asset-description), ideally
including its architecture. Beyond the standards, you should share any or all special
concerns about the asset. The following checklist includes examples to help you decide
what to share with your pentesters. While you're not required to include any such
details, we encourage you to include concerns, especially if they affect your
production systems.

- Highlight areas for special attention, such as:
  - Recent releases
  - Specific functionality
- Vulnerabilities that you're concerned about
  - Be specific. Include CVE numbers (or equivalent) if available.
- Requirements to access the target environment:
  - For example, if you're looking for a test on the internal network, include instructions on
    how to access the [Jump Box](../../glossary#jump-box) on that network.
- Production concerns. If you're setting up a test on production systems, share details that could affect
  your network.
- Out-of-scope subjects. Highlight any features or workflows that are out of scope for this test.
  - **We discourage "out of scope" lists.**

Denial of Service (DoS) tests, by default, are out of scope.
You can explicitly request DoS tests.
