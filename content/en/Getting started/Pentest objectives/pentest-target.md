To set up a pentest, you need to define the location of your asset.
Since the pentests that we support are all "online", that normally means
pointing to their location(s) on the Internet.

| Asset Type       | Typical Target                                                                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web              | Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) such as www.example.com. May also specify an IP or network address.            |
| Mobile           | URL where anyone can download a mobile app, such as on Google Play or the Apple App Store.                                               |
| API              | Base URL of the API. You can define the endpoints / queries in the Instructions text box. |
| External Network | IP addresses or the IP network address.                                                   |
| Internal Network | IP network address. External IP address for the [Jump Box]().                             |
| Cloud Config     | IP address(es) and FQDNs of your cloud components.                                        |

Once you've defined the target(s), the next step is to specify the
[Pentest Methodology](../methodologies/).
