  Your pentesters need dedicated accounts to test your systems.

Be sure to delete these pentester accounts after the process is complete.

You would not share a user account with someone who is trying to break into your system.
However, best practice for pentests assume that a black-hat hacker has somehow gained
access to a valid account.

Our pentests therefore require that you set up dedicated accounts for **each** of our
pentesters with appropriate privileges and permissions. While you're welcome to use
our software to share these credentials, you can also use the encryption software of
your choice.

When you share information on the dedicated accounts:

- Make sure you've created one (1) account per pentester.
  - Share username/password information using the _secure_ channel of your choice.
  - Alternatively, share documentation on how your pentesters can set their own passwords.
- Describe the user role along with associated permissions and/or privileges.
- Include other authentication requirements such as two-factor authentication (2FA).

Before sharing this information, make sure the account works.

Depending on the methodology, we may also perform
[black-box](../../glossary/#black-box-testing) and 
[gray-box](../../glossary/#gray-box-testing) tests.


Now proceed to the next step, special [Instructions](../special-instructions).
