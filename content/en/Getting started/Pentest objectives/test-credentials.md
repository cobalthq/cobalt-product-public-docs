In our journey through **Pentest Requirements**, we now discuss **Test Credentials**.
When you see that title, select from the following options:

- `You will provide credentials for each pentester`
- `You need pentester email addresses`
  - We'll share email addresses once your pentest is in the [Planned](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/) state.
- `Pentesters can create their own credentials / No authentication required`

Explain the process in the special [Instructions](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/special-instructions/), based on the
following use cases:
- If our pentesters can create their own accounts on your system
- If our pentesters can test your system without credentials


If you've set up dedicated accounts:

- Remember to create one (1) account per pentester.
  - Make sure each test account works.
  - Share documentation on how your pentesters can set their own passwords.
  - If necessary, share username/password (or other credential) information using the _secure_ channel of your choice.
- Describe the user role along with associated permissions and/or privileges.
- Include other authentication requirements such as [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/glossary/#multi-factor-authentication).
- Once the pentest (and any retests) are complete, delete the dedicated accounts.

Depending on the methodology, we may also perform
[black-box](/glossary/#black-box-testing) and 
[gray-box](/glossary/#gray-box-testing) tests.

Now proceed to the next step, special [Instructions](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/special-instructions/).
