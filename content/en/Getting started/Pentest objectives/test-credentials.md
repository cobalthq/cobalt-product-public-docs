In our journey through **Pentest Objectives**, we now discuss **Test Credentials**.
When you see that title, select from the following options:

- **I will create testing account(s) and provide credentials**
- **I need pentesters email(s) address to create or share test account(s) credentials** 
  - We'll share email addresses once your pentest is in the "planned" state. 
- **No credentials required** 
  - Explain the process in the special [Instructions](../special-instructions),
    based on the following use cases:
    - If our pentesters can create their own accounts on your system
    - If our pentesters can test your system without accounts

If you've set up dedicated accounts:

- Remember to create one (1) account per pentester.
  - Make sure each test account works.
  - Share username/password (or other credential) information using the _secure_ channel of your choice.
  - Alternatively, share documentation on how your pentesters can set their own passwords.
- Describe the user role along with associated permissions and/or privileges.
- Include other authentication requirements such as two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Once the pentest (and any retests) are complete, delete the dedicated accounts.

Depending on the methodology, we may also perform
[black-box](../../../glossary/#black-box-testing) and 
[gray-box](../../../glossary/#gray-box-testing) tests.

Now proceed to the next step, special [Instructions](../special-instructions).
