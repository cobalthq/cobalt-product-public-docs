In previous sections, you've saved what you've entered for the pentest.
Now you can review your work. Before selecting **Submit For Review**, follow this checklist for [Requirements](#requirements) and [Details](#details).

![Review your pentest](/gsg/EditPentestSubmitForReview.png "Review pentest details")

For both tabs, you can select **Edit** to make changes.

## Requirements

Under the **Requirements** tab, you can review:

- [Pentest type](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-types/)
- [Targets](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/pentest-target/)
- [Pentest methodology](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/methodologies/), for [combined assets](/getting-started/assets/asset-type/)
- [Objectives](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/), which define methodologies that our pentesters use as a checklist
- [Test credentials](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/test-credentials/)
- [Instructions](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/special-instructions/) for pentesters
- [Technology stack](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/stack/) behind your asset

### Additional Requests

You can specify special requirements for pentesters. For example, if
industry, company, or national regulations require that you limit pentesters
to residents of one or more countries, you can request this.

Scroll down to the bottom of the **Requirements** tab, select **Show advanced options**, and add your notes under **Additional requests**.

We can't guarantee that we'll accept your additional request. This may also delay scheduling the pentest.
