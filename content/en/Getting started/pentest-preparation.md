Learn what you need to prepare to set up a pentest with Cobalt.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

The information you need to prepare before launching a pentest depends on your [asset type](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/):

- [Web application](#web-application)
- [Mobile application](#mobile-application)
- [API](#api)
- [External network](#external-network)
- [Internal network](#internal-network)
- [Cloud configuration](#cloud-configuration)
- [Combined assets](#combined-assets)

## Web Application

Learn [how to scope a pentest for a web app](/getting-started/planning/#web) in the Cobalt UI.

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- Depending on the type of your web application:
  - [Traditional application](/getting-started/glossary/#traditional-web-application): The number of [dynamic pages](/getting-started/glossary/#dynamic-web-page). A dynamic page is a web page with dynamic content that a user can interact with.
    - Count the number of dynamic pages based on unique page templates.
    - Read-only [static pages](/getting-started/glossary/#static-web-page) are not counted because there is no interaction.
    - A product catalog is not counted because the page workflow is not unique.
  - [Single-page application](/getting-started/glossary/#single-page-application): The number of [routes](/getting-started/glossary/#route-software) in the application. In single-page applications using frameworks such as Angular, React, Ember, Backbone, or Meteor, logical separation of content is handled by routes. Routes provide unique URLs to specific content within the application. As an example, read the [React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/concepts) to learn more about routing.
- Basic information about the [user roles](/getting-started/glossary/#user-role), such as:
  - The number of different role types you want to test
  - Permission structure for user roles
- Application URLs or domain names
- Test credentials for each pentester
- Technology stack
- What's in and out of scope for the pentest (for example, APIs)
- Product walk-through or documentation, if available
- If the scope is not publicly available, whitelist Cobalt IPs
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any
- Optional:
  - User role matrix
  - List of priorities (for example, focus on new features or specific workflows)
  - Attack vectors you're most concerned about

## Mobile Application

Learn [how to scope a pentest for a mobile app](/getting-started/planning/#mobile) in the Cobalt UI.

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- Operating systems (OSes) the application runs on:
  - **Native applications** are built to run on a specific mobile operating system, such as iOS or Android.
  - **Non-native applications** are built to run on multiple operating systems.
- The number of [screens](/getting-started/glossary/#mobile-screen) (views) for all operating systems. A screen is a screen-sized interface that a user interacts with on a mobile device. Screens in a mobile application are functionally equivalent to [dynamic pages](/getting-started/glossary/#dynamic-web-page) in a [web](#web-application) application.
- Basic information about the [user roles](/getting-started/glossary/#user-role), such as:
  - The number of different role types you want to test
  - Permission structure for user roles
- Application framework
- Access to your application:
  - Downloadable links, if the application is publicly available
  - IPA or APK files, if the application is not publicly available
- If the application is not in production yet, TestFlight or Crashlytics access
- Test credentials for each pentester
- Technology stack
- What's in and out of scope for the pentest (for example, APIs)
- Product walk-through or documentation, if available
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any

## API

Learn [how to scope a pentest for an API](/getting-started/planning/#api) in the Cobalt UI.

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- Depending on the type of your API:
  - [RESTful API](/getting-started/glossary/#restful-api): The number of [endpoints](/getting-started/glossary/#api-endpoint) in the API. Ignore specific parameters and HTTP methods for each endpoint.
  - [GraphQL API](/getting-started/glossary/#graphql-api): The number of [queries and mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries) in your API. For pentest purposes, that’s functionally equivalent to the number of RESTful API endpoints.
- Sample requests and responses
- Basic information about the [user roles](/getting-started/glossary/#user-role), such as:
  - The number of different role types you want to test
  - Permission structure for user roles
- Technology stack
- Documentation, if available: Swagger, Postman, SoapUI projects or OpenAPI files
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any

## External Network

Learn [how to scope a pentest for an external network](/getting-started/planning/#external-network) in the Cobalt UI.

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- The number of active hosts in the network:
  - An explicit number of live hosts; or
  - A CIDR block along with a saturation percentage
- IPs or IP ranges
- Domain names
- High-level overview of the network (preferably, with a network diagram)
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any

## Internal Network

Learn [how to scope a pentest for an internal network](/getting-started/planning/#internal-network) in the Cobalt UI.

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- The number of active hosts in the network
- IPs or IP ranges
- Remote connectivity method<!--(See best practices in [Internal Network Penetration Testing Methodology](/methodologies/internal-network/).)-->
- Proper positioning on the network to assess the environment (network visibility)
- For PCI pentests, the need for segmentation testing
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any
- Other considerations that may affect the scope: for example, multiple [jump boxes](/getting-started/glossary/#jump-box) on the network

Because Cobalt pentesters execute pentests for internal networks remotely, they need:

- Access to the internal corporate network through a stable VPN connection; and
- A lightweight Linux server inside the network that serves as a [jump box](/getting-started/glossary/#jump-box) from which pentesters can scan and test the internal network during the assessment.

Other requirements:

- For **internal networks running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) machines**, we will:
  - Send you a [link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fznsw3f7mq7to) to create a Kali Virtual Machine (VM) inside AWS.
  - Ask you to set up key-based SSH access for each pentester.
- For **networks that don't use a cloud network setup**, do the following:
  - [Download a Kali VMWare/VirtualBox image](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/).
  - Set up key-based SSH access for each pentester.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Recommended system resources for the virtual image (VMWare, VirtualBox, or AWS) should be at least:

- 2 allocated virtual CPUs
- 8 GB RAM
- 20 GB of disk space

Pentesters also need Root access to the Kali VM, which is mandatory.

## Cloud Configuration

Cobalt pentesters can test services on the following platforms:

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure Cloud (Azure)

Each platform includes different categories of services, such as EC2, databases, and machine learning engines.

Learn [how to scope a pentest for a cloud configuration](/getting-started/planning/#cloud-configuration) in the Cobalt UI.

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- Your cloud platform: GCP, AWS, or Azure
- Depending on your cloud platform, the number of User Accounts, Projects, or Resource Groups:
  - **GCP**: The cloud configuration size is based on _Projects_. In Identity and Access Management (IAM), access is managed through IAM policies. An IAM policy can be attached to a Google Cloud Project. Each policy contains a collection of role bindings that associate one or more principals, such as users or service accounts, with an IAM role.
  - **AWS**: The number of AWS accounts within the AWS Organization. The IAM user that pentesters will use to enumerate and assess AWS configurations is set based upon these accounts.
  - **Azure**: Subscriptions may contain various Resource Groups—containers that hold related resources for an Azure solution. The CIS Benchmark for Azure is assessed at the Subscription level.
- The number of **unique services** in the configuration. Unique services are the different functionalities that you've configured in your cloud deployment.
  - Examples of services: EC2, S3, Comprehend, Kubernetes, Azure Bot Service, Cloud Storage, Azure Container Service.
  - Cobalt sizes _Unique Instance of Services Used_ for Cloud Configuration Reviews as we're enumerating configurations, not hosts. Example: 100 EC2 instances using the same base image are considered redundant from the configuration perspective and counted as 1 unique service.
- High-level overview of the cloud setup: Providers and Services (preferably, with diagrams)
- IAM read-only access for pentesters (for example, SecurityAudit and ViewOnlyAccess for AWS)
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any
