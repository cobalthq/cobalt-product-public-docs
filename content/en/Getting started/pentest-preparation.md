**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- Type of your web application:
  - [Traditional application](/getting-started/glossary/#traditional-web-application): How many [dynamic pages](/getting-started/glossary/#dynamic-web-page) does the application have?
  - [Single-page application](/getting-started/glossary/#single-page-application): How many [routes](/getting-started/glossary/#route-software) does the application have? As an example, read the [React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/concepts) to learn more about routing.
- Application URLs or domain names
- Test credentials for each pentester and basic information about the [user roles](/getting-started/glossary/#user-role), such as:
  - The number of different role types you want to test
  - Permission structure for user roles
- Technology stack
- What's in and out of scope for the pentest (for example, APIs)
- Product walk-through or documentation, if available
- If the scope is not publicly available, whitelist Cobalt IPs
- Optional:
  - User role matrix
  - List of priorities (for example, focus on new features or specific workflows)
  - Attack vectors you are most concerned about
  - Special requirements for the pentest, if any
