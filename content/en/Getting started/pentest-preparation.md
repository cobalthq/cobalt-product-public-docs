Learn what you need to prepare to set up a pentest with Cobalt.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

The information you need to prepare before launching a pentest depends on your [asset type](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/):

- [Web application](#web-application)
- [Mobile application]()
- [API]()
- [External network]()
- [Internal network]()
- [Cloud configuration]()
- [Combined assets]()

## Web Application

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- Type of your web application:
  - [Traditional application](/getting-started/glossary/#traditional-web-application): How many [dynamic pages](/getting-started/glossary/#dynamic-web-page) does the application have?
  - [Single-page application](/getting-started/glossary/#single-page-application): How many [routes](/getting-started/glossary/#route-software) does the application have? As an example, read the [React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/concepts) to learn more about routing.
- Application URLs or domain names
- Test credentials for each pentester and basic information about the [user roles](/getting-started/glossary/#user-role), such as:
  - The number of different role types you want to test
  - Permission structure for user roles
- Technology stack
- What's in and out of scope for the pentest (for example, APIs)
- Product walk-through or documentation, if available
- If the scope is not publicly available, whitelist Cobalt IPs
- Optional:
  - User role matrix
  - List of priorities (for example, focus on new features or specific workflows)
  - Attack vectors you are most concerned about
  - Special requirements for the pentest, if any

## Mobile Application

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- Application framework
- Operating systems (OSes) the application runs on
- Access to your application:
  - Downloadable links, if the application is publicly available; or
  - IPA or APK files, if the application is not publicly available
- If the application is not in production yet: TestFlight or Crashlytics on how to get access
- Test credentials for each pentester
- Technology stack
- What's in and out of scope for the pentest (for example, APIs)
- Product walk-through or documentation, if available
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any

## API

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- Type of your API:
  - [RESTful API](/getting-started/glossary/#restful-api): The number of [endpoints](/getting-started/glossary/#api-endpoint) in the API. Ignore specific parameters and HTTP methods for each endpoint.
  - [GraphQL API](/getting-started/glossary/#graphql-api): The number of [queries and mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries) in your API.
- Sample requests and responses
- Technology stack
- Documentation, if available: Swagger, Postman, SoapUI projects or OpenAPI files
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any

## External Network

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- The number of active hosts in the network
- IPs or IP ranges
- Domain names
- High-level overview of the network (network diagram)
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any

Learn [how to scope a pentest for an external network](/getting-started/planning/#external-network) in the Cobalt UI.

## Internal Network

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- The number of active hosts in the network
- IPs or IP ranges
- Remote connectivity method (See best practices in [Internal Network Penetration Testing Methodology](/methodologies/internal-network/))
- Proper positioning on the network to assess the environment (network visibility)
- For PCI pentests: mention of the Segmentation need
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any
- Other considerations that may affect the scope: for example, multiple [jump boxes](/getting-started/glossary/#jump-box) on the network

Because Cobalt pentesters execute pentests for internal networks remotely, they need:

- Access to the internal corporate network through a stable VPN connection; and
- A lightweight Linux server inside the network that serves as a [jump box]((/getting-started/glossary/#jump-box)) from which pentesters can scan and test the internal network during the assessment.

Other requirements:

- For **internal networks running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) machines**, we will:
  - Send you a [link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fznsw3f7mq7to) to create a Kali Virtual Machine (VM) inside AWS.
  - Ask you to set up key-based SSH access for each pentester.
- For **networks that don't use a cloud network setup**, do the following:
  - [Download a Kali VMWare/VirtualBox image](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/).
  - Set up key-based SSH access for each pentester.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Recommended system resources for the virtual image (VMWare, VirtualBox, or AWS) should be at least:

- 2 allocated virtual CPUs
- 8 GB RAM
- 20 GB of disk space

Pentesters also need Root access to the Kali VM, which is mandatory.

## Cloud Configuration

**Information needed to set up your pentest**:

- Your cloud platform: GCP, AWS, or Azure
- High-level overview of the cloud setup: Providers and Services (diagrams)
- The number of account IDs and unique services in the configuration
- IAM read-only access for pentesters (for example, for AWS SecurityAudit and ViewOnlyAccess)
- Special requirements for the pentest, if any

Cobalt pentesters can test services on the following platforms:

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure Cloud (Azure)

Each platform includes different categories of services, such as EC2, databases, and machine learning engines.

## Combined Assets

For an asset that combines multiple asset types, follow the guidelines for each type:

- [Web](#web-application) + [API](#api)
- [Web](#web-application) + [API](#api) + [External Network](#external-network)
- [Web](#web-application) + [External Network](#external-network)
- [Web](#web-application) + [Mobile](#mobile-application)
