You want to enhance the security of your software. You're ready to set up
penetration tests (pentests) to elevate your security posture. With
pentest-driven solutions, you can comply with regulations and enhance
the confidence of your customers.

You've come to the right place.

If you're considering Cobalt, read this document, and visualize the process.
If you've already purchased Cobalt, use this document to start your journey.

While it's helpful if you have a background as a developer, it's not required
to understand the pentest process. 

If the language of software security confuses you, refer to our
[Glossary](./glossary).

Your journey takes you through the following major steps:

1. Accept your email invitation, and [Sign in to Cobalt](./sign-in).
1. [Define Your Asset](./define-assets). Our pentesters test all kinds of
   assets, from web apps to internal networks.
1. Create [objectives](./pentest-objectives) for your pentest.
   - By default, our pentests are based on standards defined by the
     [Open Web Application Security
     Project (OWASP)](../glossary#open-web-application-security-project) and in
     the [Open Source Security Testing Methodology
     Manual](../glossary/open-source-security-testing-methodology-manual-osstmm).
   - You're welcome to add and modify the objectives of your choice.
   - We encourage you to include more information about your asset, such as
     architecture and coding language.
1. Define [limitations](../pentest-methodologies) on your environment.
   Is your asset in production or in development? Does part of your system
   reside on a Cloud platform? You'll answer these questions in this stage.
1. Once you've defined your asset and desired test, you can start
   [scheduling](../pentest-planning) the test, as well as define the number
   of credits to use.
