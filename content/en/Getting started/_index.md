You want to enhance the security of your software. You're ready to set up
penetration tests (pentests) to elevate your security posture. With
pentest-driven solutions, you can comply with regulations and enhance
the confidence of your customers. You want results as soon as possible.

You've come to the right place.

If you're considering Cobalt, use this document to help you visualize the process.
If you've already purchased Cobalt credits, use this document to start your journey.

While it's helpful if you have a background in security, it's not required
to understand the pentest process. If the language of software security confuses
you, refer to our [Glossary](./glossary).

In this Getting Started Guide, we take you through the process to create a pentest,
step by step, and set [expectations](./what-to-expect).

When you've finished this Getting Started Guide, you'll have a plan and scope that
our pentesters can use to test your assets. When you purchase credits from Cobalt,
we send you an email invitation, which you can use to [Sign in to Cobalt](./sign-in).

## Overview

Our journey takes you through the steps required to create a pentest:

1. [Define Your Assets](./assets). Our pentesters analyze all kinds of
   assets, from web apps to internal networks.
1. Create [objectives](./pentest-objectives) for your pentest.
   - By default, our pentesters use standards defined by the
     [Open Web Application Security
     Project (OWASP)](./glossary#open-web-application-security-project-owasp) and in
     the [Open Source Security Testing Methodology
     Manual](./glossary/#open-source-security-testing-methodology-manual-osstmm).
   - Add and modify the objectives of your choice.
   - To help our penetration testers, include more information about your asset,
     such as architecture and coding language. You'll see more details about
     what to include when you [Define Your Assets](./assets).
1. Define [details](./details) of your environment.
   Is your asset in production or in development? Is part of your system
   on a Cloud platform?
1. Start [planning](./planning) the test. Define your desired pentest start
   date. We need time to find the best available pentesters for your assets.
1. Review your pentest request. Use our [Pentest Checklist](./checklist) to make
   sure you've included _all_ information that our pentesters need.

Once you've set up a pentest, we start analyzing your asset. When
possible, we share results even before we create your report. Here's what
you can [expect](./what-to-expect). 

Assuming you've received an email invitation, take the next step.
