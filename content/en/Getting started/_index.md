### 1. Discover Your Attack Surface

Find all of your externally reachable targets by scanning your domains. Our [Attack Surface](/attack-surface) feature automatically maps your internet-facing assets, so you can easily see what's exposed and identify potential vulnerabilities.
 
### 2. Automate Vulnerability Scanning

Start scanning for vulnerabilities in your web applications and APIs with our [Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scanner](/scans). Every customer gets one target for FREE with unlimited scanning.

### 3. Define Your Assets

Clearly [define your assets](/assets/create-asset) to ensure your pentests are comprehensive and efficient. Your [assets](/assets/asset-types) are the web applications, APIs, or other systems you want to have tested.

### 4. Start a Pentest

Schedule and launch a [pentest](/pentests) directly from the Cobalt platform. Choose your desired start date and testing methodology to begin protecting your assets.

### 5. Integrate Your Tools

Connect Cobalt with the tools you already use, like Jira or GitHub, using our [Integration Builder](/integrations/integrationbuilder). This no-code platform lets you automate security workflows and share data seamlessly.

### 6. Plan Your Security Program

Centrally visualize and manage your annual testing program. Use our [Planning](/planning) feature to plan, track, and execute all of your tests in one place.
