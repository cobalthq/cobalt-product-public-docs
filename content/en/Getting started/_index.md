You want to enhance the security of your software. You're ready to set up penetration tests
(pentests) to elevate your security posture. With pentest-driven solutions, you can comply
with regulations and enhance the confidence of your customers.

You've come to the right place.

If you're considering Cobalt, read this document, and visualize the process.
If you've already purchased Cobalt, use this document to start your journey.

While it's helpful if you have a background as a developer, it's not required to understand
the pentest process. 

If the language of software security confuses you, refer to our [Glossary].
