When you get access to Cobalt, you'll first see an email invitation titled:

**Welcome to the Cobalt Platform**

The email invite should include a link to Get Started:

<br>
<div class="mx-auto">
        <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary mr-3 mb-4" href="https://cobaltio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360005476672-Cobalt-Platform">
                Get Started <i class="fas"></i>
        </a>
</div>

Now you can:

1. Select the link.
1. From the webpage that appears, create a password. Follow the complexity
   requirements on the screen. We require passwords with at least:
   - Eight (8) characters
   - One (1) uppercase letter
   - One (1) lowercase letter
   - One (1) digit
   1. We include a link to our [Terms and Conditions](https://cobalt.io/terms/general).
1. Once you've set a password, you should see the Cobalt app.
1. The next time you want to sign in, navigate to https://app.cobalt.io.
   - Your username is your email address.

You can now use the Cobalt app to start setting up a Pentest. The next step is
to [Define Your Assets](../assets).
