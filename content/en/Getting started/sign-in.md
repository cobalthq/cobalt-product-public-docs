This page assumes that you've received a welcome email from Cobalt.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Even if you haven't yet purchased Cobalt credits, this page (and document)
can help you visualize how you can set up a pentest with the Cobalt UI.

You've just received an email with the following title:

```
Welcome to the Cobalt Platform: Let's Get Started
```

Open the email. It should include a link to Get Started:

![Cobalt Welcome Email](/WelcomeEmail.png "Get Started")

Now you can:

1. Select the link in your email.

1. From the webpage that appears, create a password. Follow the complexity
   requirements on the screen. We require passwords with at least:
   - Eight (8) characters
   - One (1) uppercase letter
   - One (1) lowercase letter
   - One (1) digit

   We also include a link to our [Terms and Conditions](https://cobalt.io/terms/general).

1. Once you've set a password, you should see the Cobalt app.

1. The next time you want to sign in, navigate to https://app.cobalt.io.
   - Your username is your email address.

You can now use the Cobalt app to start setting up a Pentest. The next step is
to [Define Your Assets](../assets).

We support two-factor authentication. After you sign in, select the icon in the upper-right
corner and select **Security Settings**.

We also support SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), which supports SSO
(Single Sign-On) based on third party accounts such as Google. To set up SAML,
select **Settings > Identity & Access** from the left-hand menu.
