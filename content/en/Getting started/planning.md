Now you can set a date for the pentest.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

By default, we can help you schedule pentests with a start date at least
two (2) business days after you select "Submit for Review."

Normally, we complete our pentests in two (2) weeks.

![Pentester Planning](/gsg/PentestPlanning.png "Schedule your pentest. Start at least 2 business days from today.")

On the Pentest Planning screen, you can also update the asset scope, and the number of credits required for the test.

## Additional Requests

You can also specify special requirements for pentesters. For example, if
industry, company, or national regulations require that you limit pentesters
to residents of one or more countries, you can do so here:

![Pentester Limits](/gsg/PentesterLimits.png "Specify legal or regulatory limitations on pentesters.")

Congratulations! If you're ready with your pentest, select
**Save & Exit** > **Yes**.

In the next screen, you can review your work, as a [checklist](../checklist).
