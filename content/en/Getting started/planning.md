Now you can set a date for the pentest.

Depending on your {{% ptaas-tier %}},
we can help you schedule pentests with a start date from at least one to three business days after you select "Submit for Review."

We reserve two (2) weeks to complete our pentests.

![Pentester Planning](/gsg/PentestPlanning.png "Schedule your pentest. Your allowed start date depends on your PtaaS Tier and any special requirements.")

On the Pentest Planning screen, you can also update the asset scope, and the number of credits required for the test.

If you have any special requirements, such as qualifications for pentester certifications,
we reserve the right to start the pentest later than the flow time specified in your
{{% ptaas-tier %}}.

## Additional Requests

You can also specify special requirements for pentesters. For example, if
industry, company, or national regulations require that you limit pentesters
to residents of one or more countries, you can do so here:

![Pentester Limits](/gsg/PentesterLimits.png "Specify legal or regulatory limitations on pentesters.")

If you're ready with your pentest, select **Save & Exit** > **Yes**.

In the next screen, you can review your work, as a [checklist](../checklist).
