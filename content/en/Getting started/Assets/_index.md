  Security professionals perform pentests on your assets. Collect the info they need.

{{% pageinfo %}}
You can launch multiple pentests for an [asset](/getting-started/glossary/#asset). Once you've set up an asset, you can reuse it in your next pentests.

## Create an Asset

Once you've [signed in](/getting-started/sign-in/), you land on the **Assets** page.

- To add a single asset, select **New Asset**. Specify [asset details](#asset-details).
- To upload assets in bulk in CSV or XLSX format, select **Bulk Assets**. Once uploaded, you can select an asset to add an image, [technology stack](/platform-deep-dive/assets/risk-advisories/#add-a-technology-stack-for-your-asset), and [attachments](/getting-started/assets/asset-description/#attachments).
  - If the upload is successful, all your assets from the file are added. Otherwise, no assets are created. Our algorithm doesn't process the request partially.
  - We don't prevent you from creating duplicate assets.

## Asset Details

The **Asset** screen prompts you for the following information:

- **Asset Title**: Set up a descriptive name to attract attention from the best pentesters.
- **Asset Image**: Use it to help identify what you need from a list of assets.
- [Asset Type](/getting-started/assets/asset-type/): Select one of the options described in the linked page.
- [Technology Stack](/platform-deep-dive/assets/risk-advisories/#add-a-technology-stack-for-your-asset) (for Web, Mobile, API, and combined asset types): Add a technology stack for your asset. You can preview [potential vulnerabilities](/platform-deep-dive/assets/risk-advisories/) based on the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/) standard for this stack.
- [Asset Description](/getting-started/assets/asset-description/): Add information that can help your pentesters fully analyze your asset.
- [Attachments](/getting-started/assets/asset-description/#attachments): Upload documentation, architecture diagrams, images, spreadsheets, or videos related to your asset.
- [Tags](#asset-tags): {{% asset-tag-definition %}} Learn [how to use asset tags](#asset-tags).

### Asset Tags

{{% asset-tag-definition %}} You can add multiple tags to an asset. Use tags to:

- Map your assets to external systems, such as your vulnerability management application or task tracking software. Add the asset identifier in your third-party system as a tag.
- Associate other metadata such as vulnerabilities in external systems with Cobalt assets.
- Assign internal teams or business units to manage specific assets in Cobalt.
- Assign a compliance audit type the asset is subject to, such as `SOC 2`, `PCI-DSS`, or `CREST`.

You can also add asset tags using the Cobalt API. Learn more in our [API documentation](https://docs.cobalt.io/v2/#assets).
