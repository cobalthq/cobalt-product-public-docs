The **Let's get started!** screen includes two options:

- **Create a new pentest from an existing asset**
  - From the list of your assets that appears, choose an asset. Once you select **Next**, you can see the Asset screen with available information.
- **Create a new pentest for a new asset**

This section can help you define your asset. In the Cobalt UI, you can
define pentest objectives in the following screen:

![Asset Screen](/gsg/PentestWizardAsset.png "Define your asset here")

This page corresponds to the Assets that you can set up in the Cobalt app.
You can access the UI to define your assets in the following ways:

- Select Assets in the left-hand pane, and select New Asset.
- Select Assets or Pentests in the left-hand pane, and select Create a Pentest.
  When you set up a pentest, the wizard allows you to define an asset.

This Getting Started Guide assumes that you're setting up an asset as part of
setting up a pentest.

The UI provides the information that you need to add an Asset Image and Title.
Now take the next step and define your [Asset Type](./asset-type).
