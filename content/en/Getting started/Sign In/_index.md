Even if you haven't yet purchased Cobalt credits, this page (and document)
can help you visualize how you can set up a pentest with the Cobalt UI.

You've just received an email with the following title:

```
Welcome to the Cobalt Platform: Let's Get Started
```
{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}}
SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) availability is based on your <!-- is available to all --> <a href="https://www.cobalt.io/pentest-pricing" target="_blank">PtaaS tier</a>.
{{% /alert %}}

Open the email. It should include a link to Get Started:

![Cobalt Welcome email](/gsg/WelcomeEmail.png "Get Started")

Now you can:

1. Select the link in your email.

1. From the webpage that appears, create a password. Follow the complexity
   requirements on the screen. We require passwords with at least:
   - Eight (8) characters
   - One (1) uppercase letter
   - One (1) lowercase letter
   - One (1) digit

   We also include a link to our [Terms and Conditions](https://cobalt.io/terms/general).

1. Once you've set a password, you should see the Cobalt app.

1. The next time you want to sign in, navigate to https://app.cobalt.io.
   - Your username is your email address.

   ![Cobalt Sign In Screen](/gsg/SignIn.png "sign in")

   You can now use the Cobalt app to start setting up a pentest.

1. Select **Create a Pentest**. Now proceed to the next step, [Define Your Assets](../assets).

## Two-Factor Authentication

We support two-factor authentication. After you sign in, select the icon in the upper-right
corner and select **Security Settings**.
