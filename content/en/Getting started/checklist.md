### Co-branded Reports

If your organization manages pentests for third parties, you can add your company logo to all reports. In co-branded reports, your company logo appears next to the Cobalt logo.

An [_Organization Owner_](../glossary/#organization-owner) of a partner company can enable co-branded reports.

<ul><li>Your name</li>
<li>Your organization name</li>
<li>List of client organizations you manage</li>
<li>Reason: Enable partner co-branding functionality</li></ul></li>

<li>Once we've processed your request, you get access to specific functionality as a <i>Cobalt Partner</i>, which you can verify on the <b>People</b> tab next to your name.</li>

<li>To enable co-branded reports for an organization you manage:
<ul><li>Select the organization in the upper-left corner.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <b>Settings</b> tab, and scroll down to the <b>Report Branding</b> section.</li>
