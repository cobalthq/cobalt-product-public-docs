### Co-branded Reports

If your organization manages pentests for third parties, you can add your company logo to all reports. In co-branded reports, your company logo appears next to the Cobalt logo.

An [_Organization Owner_](../glossary/#organization-owner) of a partner company can enable co-branded reports. Navigate to the **Settings** tab in your dashboard, and scroll down to the **Report Branding** section.

## When You're Ready

If you're ready with your pentest, select **Submit for Review**.

Once you do so, learn [what to expect after you create a
