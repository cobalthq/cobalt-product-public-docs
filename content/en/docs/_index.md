Cobalt is creating product documentation. As we build it, we plan to expand
our product documentation to help you visualize and diagnose problems that
you may have, without creating a ticket.

We hope to create a "Getting Started" guide soon. We're starting the process
with links to existing Cobalt literature.

## Support Articles

When customers need help with the Cobalt App, they frequently rely on support articles, available through the [Cobalt Zendesk](https://cobaltio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360005476672-Cobalt-Platform) interface.

If you're a Cobalt customer, connect to Zendesk and select the **Sign in** link.
Once connected, you'll have access to more support articles.

## API Documentation

Cobalt has a read-only [RESTful API](https://docs.cobalt.io/)
that allows you to call the following data related to your pentests:

- Organizations
- Assets
- Pentests
- Findings
- Events
- Tokens

To use our REST calls, you'll need to generate an API Token from your
[Cobalt profile](https://app.cobalt.io/settings/api-token).


## Blog Posts

Cobalt has an extensive library of [blog posts](https://cobalt.io/blog),
designed to help and inform you about:

- Cobalt and our product
- Profiles for many of Our pentesters

- Standards and how you can meet them
