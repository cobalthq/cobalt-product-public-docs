This page includes notable external changes to Cobalt software.

The format is based on guidance from [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

This changelog includes two types of versioning:

- Product: [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org)
- API: [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
{{% /pageinfo %}}

<!-- Use this template to set up a new changelog entry

Change the date, enter the changes to highlight, and add the info to the "top"
of the page, right after this commented template.

Users can then see the latest changelog entries first, and scroll down
for older entries.

Leave out unused entries. For example, if we have not `Removed` a feature,
do not use the `### Removed` header.
