## Process

![Lifecycle of the Cobalt pentest program](/deepdive/PentestProcessFlow.png "Lifecycle of the Cobalt pentest program")
<br><br>

Here are the stages of a Cybersecurity Services engagement:

| | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Discover** | You define what you need to test. Create an engagement brief, or make a request on the Catalog page.  |
| 2 | **Plan** | During this stage, we will determine the scope, including the [engagement type](#pentest-engagements) and methodology. Create a Statement of Work (if applicable) and set timelines. |
| 3 | **Test** | The Cobalt Cybersecurity Services team tests your asset using the determined methodology.<ul><li>We share vulnerabilities that we discover in real time, in a dedicated Slack channel.</li><li>At this stage, you can start remediating findings.</li></ul> |
| 4 | **Remediate** | The testing process is complete. Remediate discovered findings.<ul><li>We provide remediation guidance during testing.</li><li>Free retesting is depending upon the type of engagement.</li></ul> |
| 5 | **Report** | We share a report once the engagement is complete. For engagements, the [report sections](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/report-contents/) may differ compared to standard pentests. |
| 6 | **Analyze** | Once the engagement is complete, analyze the security posture of your asset.<ul><li>Deep dive into the report to assess discovered vulnerabilities with your development and security teams.</li><li>Take the required remediation actions.</li></ul> |

## Asset Types

Cybersecurity Services supports additional asset types, beyond our standard pentest [asset types](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/). You may see these asset types in the Cobalt UI:

| Asset Type | Description |
|---|---|
| IoT | An IoT ecosystem. As [defined](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/iot_device) by NIST, an IoT device has at least one transducer (sensor or actuator) for interacting directly with the physical world and at least one network interface, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth, for interfacing with the digital world. |
| Physical | Offices, buildings, data centers, campuses, or any other physical space that requires access control due to the presence of sensitive information, equipment, or processes. |
| Wireless Network | Wi-Fi networks consist of a wireless router or access point that broadcasts signals, allowing devices equipped with Wi-Fi capability (such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and smart home devices) to connect wirelessly. Users can access the internet or communicate with other devices within the network range without needing physical cables. |
| Other | Asset used in other engagements, such as phishing, red teaming, security hardening, and more.

## How to Request Cybersecurity Services

To request a Cybersecurity Service, navigate to the `Catalog` page in Cobalt. Select `Request` on the service you are interested in.

Our CSM team will reach out to start the process at a time that suits you. We will ask you to fill out a scoping form which will speed up the process.
