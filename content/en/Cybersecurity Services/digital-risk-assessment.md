### Methodology Details

Cobalt will use publicly available information and commonly used OSINT methodologies and tooling (such as those documented at https://osintframework.com) to assess an organization from an external, adversarial perspective. Cobalt will employ a passive approach to OSINT reconnaissance.
Activities conducted within a Digital Risk Assessment are noted within the brief:

- Advanced Search Engine Operators (“dorks”)
- Attempts to identify sensitive or proprietary indexed files
- Password dumps
- Attempts to identify code used for internal applications
- Email, name, phone, and username harvesting 
- Identification of employee badges on social media sites
- Company research
