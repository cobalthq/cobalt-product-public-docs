## Key Functionalities

- **Edit & Copy:** The meatball menu (...) allows you to edit or copy existing pentests into new or current contract periods.
- **Contract Period Selection:** View and copy tests from previous contract periods or start planning for the next contract period using the drop-down menu.
- **State Filtering:** Filter the table view to display pentests based on their specific states (e.g., Planned, Placeholder, Draft, In Review).

We are committed to continuously enhancing the Planning feature to meet your evolving needs and provide you with the best possible pentest management experience.
