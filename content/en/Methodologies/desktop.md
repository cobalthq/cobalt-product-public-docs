#### Specific categories that are covered as part of the Pentest include:

- Information Gathering
  - Application Architecture
  - Platform Mapping
  - Language and Framework
- Client-Side Attacks
  - Binary Analysis
  - File Analysis
  - Memory Analysis
- Network-Side Attacks
  - Installation Traffic
  - Run-Time Traffic
- Server-Side Attacks
  - TCP/UDP Attacks
  - Layer7 Attacks
