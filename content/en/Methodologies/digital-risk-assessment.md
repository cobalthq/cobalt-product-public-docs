  Review Cobalt methodology for a Digital Risk Assessment.
---

Cobalt will use publicly available information and commonly used OSINT methodologies and tooling (such as those documented at https://osintframework.com) to assess an organization from an external, adversarial perspective. Cobalt will employ a passive approach to OSINT reconnaissance.

Activities conducted within a Digital Risk Assessment are noted within the brief:

- Company research
- Domain and host enumeration
- Email, name, phone, and username harvesting
- Advanced Search Engine Operators ("dorks")
- Attempts to identify code used for internal applications
- Password dumps
- Attempts to identify sensitive or proprietary indexed files
- Identification of employee badges on social media sites
- Building layouts
- Online brand protection
