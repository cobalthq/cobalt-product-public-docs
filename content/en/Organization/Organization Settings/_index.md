If your user role allows, you can:

- Edit the [organization profile](#edit-the-organization-profile)
- Configure [security settings](#manage-security-settings)

## General

Both [Organization Owners](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/user-roles/#organization-owner) and [Members](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/user-roles/#organization-member) can edit the organization profile on the **General** tab in **Settings**:

- Upload an image for their organization.
- Edit the name and slug. The slug appears in the URL.
- Set their industry and company size. This industry selection is used on the Insights Benchmark tab to automatically default to the benchmark that matches your organization's profile.

## Identity & Access

Only [Organization Owners](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/user-roles/#organization-owner) can manage security settings on the **Identity & Access** tab:

- Configure [SAML-based single sign-on (SSO)](/platform-deep-dive/organization/organization-settings/saml-sso/).
- [Enforce SAML-based SSO](https://docs.cobalt.io/platform-deep-dive/organization/organization-settings/saml-sso/#enforce-saml-sso).
