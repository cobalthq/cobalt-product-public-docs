## Set up an Asset

If you don't yet have assets, set up an asset. {{% asset-definition %}}

<a class="btn btn-outline-primary rounded" href="/getting-started/assets/">Learn How to Create Assets »</a>

- You can run Internal Pentests on assets that you've already tested on the Cobalt platform.
- Learn more about the [asset types](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/) we support.

## Create an Internal Pentest

As an [Organization Owner](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-owner) or [Member](/getting-started/glossary/#organization-member), you can set up an Internal Pentest—following the same steps as for other [pentest types](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-types/). Some parameters in the pentest wizard may slightly differ for Internal Pentests.

To launch an Internal Pentest:

1. On the **Pentests** page, select **Create a Pentest**.
1. Under **Internal Pentest**, [select or create an asset](/getting-started/select-pentest-type/#select-or-create-an-asset) that you want to test, and then select **Continue**.<br><br>
![Select or create an asset to start setting up an Internal Pentest](/deepdive/PentestTypesInternalPentest.png "Select or create an asset to start setting up an Internal Pentest")
1. [Review your asset](/getting-started/review-asset/).
1. Set [requirements](/getting-started/pentest-objectives/) for your pentest.
1. Define the [details](/getting-started/details/) of your environment.
1. [Schedule the pentest](/getting-started/planning/#schedule-the-pentest) by setting your desired start and end date.
    - The start date and testing period are flexible.
1. [Review your pentest](/getting-started/review-pentest/) to make sure you’ve included all information that your pentesters need. When ready, select **Complete Review**. Your pentest is now Planned.
1. Invite Internal Pentesters to the pentest. Select the <i style="font-size:x-large; color: #0047AB" class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> key for instructions.

   1. On the pentest page, select **Settings** > **Collaborators**.
   1. Enter the user's email address, select the arrow next to **Add Team Member**, and then select **Internal Pentester**. Select **Add Internal Pentester** to confirm.<br><br>
   ![Add an Internal Pentester to your pentest](/deepdive/AddInternalPentester.png "Add an Internal Pentester to your pentest")<br><br>
      The user gets an email invite to work on the pentest. An Internal Pentester role has the same privileges as a [Pentest Team Member](/getting-started/glossary/#pentest-team-member), with additional access to pentester functionality.
      - To add more Internal Pentesters, follow the steps listed above. You can add one user at a time.
      - If a user is already a Pentest Team Member on the pentest, you can change their role to Internal Pentester.<br><br>
      ![Switch a user's role to Internal Pentester](/deepdive/SwitchRoleInternalPentester.png "Switch a user's role to Internal Pentester")<br>
      - You can also [add collaborators](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/organization/manage-users/#add-a-pentest-team-member) to the pentest.
   {{% /expand%}}
1. When ready, select **Launch Pentest**. Your pentest goes Live.

Once your pentest is Live, your Internal Pentesters can start testing your asset. You can track the progress in real time.

## Collaborate on a Pentest

Communicate with pentesters and collaborators in the chat throughout a pentest. To open the chat, select the chat icon on the pentest page.

We don't add Cobalt Staff members to Internal Pentests.

## Remediate Findings

You can submit findings for retest or mark them as Accepted Risk.

## View the Pentest Report

Once the pentest report is ready, you can view and download it on the **Report** tab.
