## Getting Started

As an Internal Pentester, you can perform pentests for your organization on the Cobalt platform. Once you've received an email invite to work on a pentest, follow the link in the email to get started.

When you sign in to Cobalt as an Internal Pentester, you land on the **Pentests** page showing pentests to which you're assigned.

![Pentests page that you land on as an Internal Pentester upon signing in](/deepdive/PentestsPagePentester.png "Pentests page that you land on as an Internal Pentester upon signing in")

Navigate to the pentest you plan to work on. On the pentest page, you can:

- Review the pentest scope and asset details.
- Collaborate with your organization members in the chat.
- [Submit findings](#submit-findings) that you discover.
- Update the [coverage checklist](#update-the-coverage-checklist) as you progress through the pentest.
- Use [testing tools](#use-testing-tools) to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Write a [pentest report](#write-a-pentest-report).

## Collaborate on the Pentest

Communicate with pentesters and collaborators in the chat throughout a pentest. To open the chat, select the chat icon on the pentest page.

## Apply Pentest Methodologies

To test an asset thoroughly, use [pentest methodologies](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/methodologies/) for each asset type.

## Submit Findings

A [finding](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/) is a potential security flaw in an app or physical hardware.

To report a vulnerability that you discovered:

1. On the pentest page, select **Submit Finding**.<br><br>
![Submit a new finding from the pentest page](/deepdive/SubmitFinding.png "Submit a new finding from the pentest page")
1. Add details about the finding. Make sure to provide thorough information about the vulnerability to help your organization fix it.
    - Enter a title for the vulnerability.
    - Select the vulnerability type from the list. We've categorized and listed the most common vulnerability types. Start typing in the input field, and select one of the predefined options.
    - Select the ASVS category.
    - Review and edit the vulnerability description that populates in the **Description** field. We're providing boilerplate descriptions to help you speed up the documentation process.
    - Fill in other fields with detailed information.
1. Once you're done, you can:
    - Save the finding as a draft and go back to it later.
    - Submit the finding by selecting **Submit for Triaging**. Make sure to validate the finding before proceeding.
1. To assign a severity level to the finding, select **Pending Fix** from the **State** list.
    - Assign the likelihood and business impact to the finding. The severity level is calculated based on these parameters. To learn more, visit [Severity Levels](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/severity-levels/).
    - Assign the quality level. We use this parameter to track the report quality.
    - Select **Submit evaluation** to confirm.

Your team gets notified and can start [remediating the finding](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/remediate-findings/).

## Update the Coverage Checklist

Navigate to the **Coverage** tab. As you go through the pentest scope, you can select specific items in the checklist to mark them as complete.

The checklist is based on the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) and is specific to the [asset type](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/) you're testing.

## Use Testing Tools

To save time throughout the pentest, use testing tools available on the Cobalt platform.

The Vulnerability Detector is a vulnerability scanner tool powered by Nuclei. It scans assets for potential vulnerabilities using Nuclei templates.

{{%expand "Expand to learn more." %}}

To scan an asset for potential vulnerabilities:

1. On the pentest page, navigate to the **Asset** tab.
1. Under **Vulnerability Detector**, select **New Scan**.<br><br>
![Start a new scan using the Vulnerability Detector](/deepdive/VulnerabilityDetectorStartNewScan.png "Start a new scan using the Vulnerability Detector")
1. Follow the instructions in the UI to add URLs that you want to scan, and then select **Start Scan**.
1. Once the scan is complete, you get a notification in Slack. Refresh the page to view positive scan results. They're only visible to Internal Pentesters who are not organization users.
1. Review each potential vulnerability. Decide whether you want to discard it or create a finding.
1. Follow the steps to [submit a finding](#submit-findings) to complete the process.

## Write a Pentest Report

To summarize the pentest, write a report.

1. On the pentest page, navigate to the **Report** tab, and select **Edit Report**.
1. Complete each section of the report. Some fields already contain boilerplate information. Learn more about the [report contents](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/report-contents/).
1. When you're done, change the report state to Final, and select **Submit for Review**.
    - To save your work and keep editing later, select **Save**.

All users who have access to the pentest can view and download the report.

## Finalize the Pentest

When you mark the report as Final, the pentest automatically moves to [Remediation](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/).

The pentest state changes to [Closed](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/) when all findings are fixed.
