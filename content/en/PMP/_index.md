## Introducing the Pentest Management Platform

The Cobalt Pentest Management Platform is designed to increase the efficiency and quality of your in-house pentests. This solution enables security teams to:

- Visualize your end-to-end pentest program in a single platform
- Reduce administrative work for faster turnaround times and remediation efforts
- Integrate findings into your SDLC via Jira and GitHub, or use the Cobalt API
- Standardize reporting with customizable and automated templates
- Track program improvements by leveraging ongoing test data and analytics

{{% in-house-pentest-definition %}} The workflow for In-House Pentests is similar to other pentests that you run on the Cobalt platform. Here are some key points about In-House Pentests:

- **Pentesters**: Invite pentesters of your choice.
- **Timelines**: Define the timeline for your pentest.
- **Findings**: Remediate vulnerabilities (findings), and submit them for retest.
- **Collaboration**: Communicate with pentesters and your teammates in the pentest chat, without using third-party tools.
- **Integrations**: Streamline your workflows with Cobalt integrations.
- **Reports**: Share your guidelines with pentesters to standardize reporting.
- **Analytics**: Use Cobalt insights to analyze the security posture of your assets.

<!--Here's what you need to know:
- In-House Pentests will not impact your [credit balance](/platform-deep-dive/credits/track-credits/). You can launch as many In-House Pentests as you need.
- Cobalt [pentesters](/getting-started/glossary/#pentester) are not involved in the testing process.
- You define the testing period. We don't set limitations on the start date or testing duration.
- As with other pentests, Cobalt Staff may have access to your pentests and findings.
  - You can keep track of who has, and has previously had, access to your organization on the **People** page. To view who has or had access to specific pentests, navigate to the **Collaborators** tab.
  - We do our best to keep your data safe. Learn more about our [security practices](https://www.cobalt.io/security/practices).-->
