## Introducing the Pentest Management Platform

The Cobalt Pentest Management Platform is designed to increase the efficiency and quality of your internal pentests. With this solution, security teams can:

- Manage internal pentests in one place
- Streamline end-to-end processes
- Standardize reporting for stakeholders

<span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">An Internal Pentest is a pentest that your organization's team members complete for your organization on the Cobalt platform without involving Cobalt pentesters.</span>

The workflow for Internal Pentests is similar to other pentests that you run on the Cobalt platform. Here's what you need to know:

- Internal Pentests will not impact your [credit balance](/platform-deep-dive/credits/track-credits/). You can launch as many Internal Pentests as you need.
- Cobalt [pentesters](/getting-started/glossary/#pentester) are not involved in the testing process.
- You define the testing period. We don’t set limitations on the start date or testing duration.
- As with other pentests, Cobalt Staff may have access to your pentests and findings.
  - You can keep track of who has, and has previously had, access to your organization on the **People** page. To view who has or had access to specific pentests, navigate to the **Collaborators** tab.
  - We do our best to keep your data safe. Learn more about our [security practices](https://www.cobalt.io/security/practices).
