{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Getting Started

As an In-House Pentester, you can perform pentests for your organization on the Cobalt platform. Once you've received an email invite to work on a pentest, follow the link in the email to get started.

When you sign in to Cobalt as an In-House Pentester, you land on the **Pentests** page showing pentests to which you're assigned. Navigate to the pentest you plan to work on.

On the pentest page, you can:

- Review the pentest scope and asset details.
- [Collaborate](#collaborate-on-the-pentest) with your organization members in the chat.
- [Submit findings](#submit-findings) that you discover.
- Update the [coverage checklist](#update-the-coverage-checklist) as you progress through the pentest.
- Use [testing tools](#use-testing-tools) to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Write a [pentest report](#write-a-pentest-report).

You can see the pentest timelines under **Test Period**. If you have questions, get in touch with your organization.

</p>

Before you start testing the asset, carefully read pentest requirements.

From the **Brief** tab on the pentest page, navigate to **Requirements** and **Details**. Here, you can see the following:

- Pentest targets
- Test requirements
- Credentials to access the system
- System description
- Other details needed for the pentest

To learn more about the asset you're testing, navigate to the **Asset** tab. Read about the [asset types](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/) we support on the Cobalt platform.

## Test the Asset

{{< /mermaid >}}
</p>

Start testing the asset. Use techniques and tools appropriate for the asset type you're testing. Collaborate with your team to update them on your progress.

### Collaborate on the Pentest

Communicate with pentesters and collaborators in the chat throughout a pentest. To open the chat, select the chat icon ![Chat icon](/icons/Chat.png "Chat icon") on the pentest page.

You can inform your team about the vulnerabilities that you discover.

### Follow Pentest Methodologies

A pentest methodology outlines the process a pentester follows to discover vulnerabilities.

You can apply [pentest methodologies](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/methodologies/) that Cobalt pentesters use. These methodologies are based on the industry best practices.

<!--Depending on the pentest requirements and asset type, you can follow:
- A custom methodology defined by your organization.
- Standard methodologies based on the industry best practices that Cobalt pentesters use. Learn more about the [pentest methodologies](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/methodologies/) for each asset type.-->

### Use the Vulnerability Detector

To save time throughout a pentest, use testing tools available on the Cobalt platform.

The Vulnerability Detector is a vulnerability scanner tool powered by Nuclei. It scans assets for potential vulnerabilities using Nuclei templates.

{{%expand "Learn how to use the Vulnerability Detector." %}}
<br>
To scan an asset for potential vulnerabilities:

1. On the pentest page, navigate to the **Asset** tab.
1. Under **Vulnerability Detector**, select **New Scan**.<br><br>
![Start a new scan using the Vulnerability Detector](/pmp/vulnerability-detector-start-new-scan.png "Start a new scan using the Vulnerability Detector")
1. Follow the instructions in the UI to add URLs that you want to scan, and then select **Start Scan**.
1. Once the scan is complete, refresh the page to view positive scan results (if any). They're only visible to In-House Pentesters who are not Pentest Team Members.
1. Review each potential vulnerability. Decide whether you want to discard it or create a finding.
1. Follow the steps to [submit a finding](#submit-findings) to complete the process.

### Update the Coverage Checklist

{{% coverage-definition %}}

{{%expand "Learn how to use the coverage checklist." %}}
<br>

On the pentest page, go to the **Coverage** tab. As you go through the pentest scope, select specific items in the checklist to mark them as complete. The checklist items are specific to the [asset type](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/) and pentest methodology.

The coverage checklist is not intended to describe how to perform a pentest. Its purpose is to help coordinate the work of pentesters and to ensure the baseline coverage.

- Don't limit your work to the checklist. Test the asset thoroughly based on the pentest requirements.
- Collaborate with your teammates. Multiple pentesters can cover the same security controls.
- Track the pentest progress using the checklist.

When you associate [findings](#submit-findings) with ASVS categories, they appear on the checklist within the corresponding security controls.

    - Submit the finding by selecting **Submit for Triaging**.
1. Triage the finding to verify that it's a valid issue. If possible, collaborate with your pentest team on triaging.
1. Based on the results of triaging, select a status from the **State** list:
    - **Declined**: The vulnerability is not valid.
    - **Duplicate**: The vulnerability already exists on this pentest.
    - **Out of Scope**: The vulnerability is valid, but it's out of scope for this pentest.
    - **Pending Fix**: The vulnerability is a valid issue.
        - Assign the likelihood and business impact to the finding. The [severity level](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/findings/severity-levels/) is calculated based on these parameters.
        <!--- Assign the quality level. We use this parameter to track the report quality.-->
        - Select **Submit evaluation** to confirm.

Your organization members get notified and can remediate the finding.

click E "#retest-findings"
click F "#write-a-pentest-report"
{{< /mermaid >}}
</p>

Once your organization members have fixed a finding, they submit it for retest. You get an email alert and see a notification in the Cobalt app.

1. On the pentest page, navigate to **Findings**, and select **Retest** to filter findings that are ready for retest.
1. Retest the finding to make sure that the issue was fixed.
1. When finished, change the finding state to:
    - **Fixed**, if you can't reproduce the issue.
    - **Pending Fix**, if the issue persists. You can leave a comment on the finding to provide more details.

## Write a Pentest Report

To summarize the pentest, write a report.

For specific guidelines (if any), get in touch with your organization. Cobalt provides flexibility in reporting for In-House Pentests.

1. On the pentest page, navigate to the **Report** tab, and select **Edit Report**.
1. Complete each section of the report. Some fields already contain boilerplate information. Learn more about the [report contents](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/report-contents/).
1. When you're done, change the report state to Final, and select **Submit for Review**.
    - To save your work and continue to edit later, select **Save**.
    - When you mark the report as Final, the pentest moves to Remediation. You can't move the pentest back to the Live state.

All users who have access to the pentest can view and download the report.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
The pentest state changes to [Closed](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/pentest-states/) when all findings are fixed.
{{< /alert >}}
