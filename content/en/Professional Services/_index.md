## Pentest Process

Here are the stages of a typical pentest engagement with the Cobalt Professional Services team:

1. **Planning**. You get in touch with us, and we plan the pentest engagement. Together, we determine the following:
    - Pentest scope
    - Pentest timelines
    - [Engagement type](#pentest-engagements)
    - [Pentest methodology](#pentest-methodologies)
1. **Testing**. We update you on the pentest progress in Slack and on the Cobalt platform. You can track the progress in real time.
1. **Remediation**. We provide remediation guidance during testing.
    - Remediate vulnerabilities to secure your systems.
    - We don't provide free retesting for special pentest engagements.
1. **Reporting**. We'll share a report once the pentest engagement is complete.
    - Use the report to get an overview of the security posture of your systems. Work with your team to fix vulnerabilities and enhance your security strategy.

## Reports

We'll share a report once the pentest engagement is complete. For special pentest engagements, the [report sections](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/report-contents/) may differ compared to standard pentests.

## Asset Types

For Specialized pentests run by the Cobalt Professional Services team, we support additional asset types, beyond our standard [asset types](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/):

| Asset Type | Description |
|---|---|
| IoT | An IoT device. As [defined](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/iot_device) by NIST, an IoT device has at least one transducer (sensor or actuator) for interacting directly with the physical world and at least one network interface, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth, for interfacing with the digital world. |
| Physical | An office, building, campus, or a physical device. |
| Thick Client | An application installed locally on a user's computer. |
| Wireless Network | A network that allows devices to stay connected without using wires of any kind. |
| Other | Asset used in other special pentest engagements.

## How to Launch a Pentest

A Specialized pentest that you see in the Cobalt UI is a pentest engagement conducted by the Cobalt Professional Services team.

To launch a special pentest engagement tailored to your needs, **contact our Professional Services team** at [professional_services@cobalt.io](mailto:professional_services@cobalt.io). You can't create a Specialized pentest or set up a special asset in the UI—we'll do that for you.

Once a Specialized pentest is set up, you can:

- Edit the [asset details](/getting-started/assets/#asset-details), except for the asset type.
- Edit pentest details. Some pentest parameters may slightly differ for Specialized pentests.
