## Pentest Methodologies

We follow pentest methodologies based on the industry best practices. Learn more about each methodology:

- [IoT ecosystem testing](/professional-services/methodologies/iot/)
- [Thick client application testing](/professional-services/methodologies/thick-client/)
- [Wireless network testing](/professional-services/methodologies/wireless-network/)
- Physical testing
- Threat modeling
- Phishing
- Red teaming
- Security hardening
- Secure code review

## Pentest Process

Here are the stages of a typical pentest engagement with the Cobalt Professional Services team:

1. **Planning**. You get in touch with us, and we plan the pentest engagement. Together, we determine the following:
    - Pentest scope
    - Pentest timelines
    - [Engagement type](#pentest-engagements)
    - Pentest [methodology](#pentest-methodologies)
1. **Testing**. We update you on the pentest progress in Slack and on the Cobalt platform. You can track the progress in real time.
    - Learn [how to use the coverage checklist](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/pentest-process/coverage-checklist/) to track the pentest progress.
1. **Remediation**. We provide remediation guidance during testing. Remediate vulnerabilities to secure your systems.
1. **Reporting**. We'll share a report once the pentest engagement is complete. Use the report to get an overview of the security posture of your systems. Work with your team to fix vulnerabilities and enhance your security strategy.

## Reports

We'll share a report once the pentest engagement is complete. For special pentest engagements, the report sections may slightly differ compared to standard pentests.

## Asset Types

For Specialized pentests run by the Cobalt Professional Services team, we support additional asset types, beyond our standard [asset types](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/):

| Asset Type | Description |
|---|---|
| IoT | An IoT device. As [defined](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/iot_device) by NIST, an IoT device has at least one transducer (sensor or actuator) for interacting directly with the physical world and at least one network interface, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth, for interfacing with the digital world. |
| Physical | An office, building, campus, or a physical device. |
| Thick Client | An application installed locally on a user's computer. |
| Wireless Network | A network that allows devices to stay connected without using wires of any kind. |

## How to Launch a Pentest

To launch a special pentest engagement tailored to your needs, contact our Professional Services team at [professional_services@cobalt.io](mailto:professional_services@cobalt.io). You can't create a Specialized pentest or set up a special asset in the UIâ€”we'll do that for you.

Once a Specialized pentest is set up, you can:

- Edit the [asset details](/getting-started/assets/#asset-details), except for the asset type.
- Edit pentest details. Some pentest parameters may slightly differ for Specialized pentests.
