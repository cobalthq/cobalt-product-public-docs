## Pentest Process

![Lifecycle of the Cobalt pentest program](/deepdive/PentestProcessFlow.png "Lifecycle of the Cobalt pentest program")
<br><br>

Here are the stages of an advanced pentest engagement:

| | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Discover** | You define what you need to test and [contact](mailto:professional_services@cobalt.io) the Cobalt Professional Services team.  |
| 2 | **Plan** | We arrange a kickoff call to plan, scope, and schedule your pentest. During this stage, we:<ul><li>Determine the pentest scope, including the [engagement type](#pentest-engagements) and pentest methodology.</li><li>Create a Statement of Work.</li><li>Set pentest timelines.</li></ul> |
| 3 | **Test** | The Cobalt Professional Services team tests your asset using the determined pentest methodology.<ul><li>We share vulnerabilities that we discover in real time, in a dedicated Slack channel.</li><li>At this stage, you can start remediating findings.</li></ul> |
| 4 | **Remediate** | The testing process is complete. Remediate findings that pentesters discovered.<ul><li>We provide remediation guidance during testing.</li><li>We don't provide free retesting for advanced pentests.</li></ul> |
| 5 | **Report** | We share a report once the pentest engagement is complete.<ul><li>For advanced pentests, the [report sections](/platform-deep-dive/pentests/reports/report-contents/) may differ compared to standard pentests.</li><li>We also offer a debrief call where you can ask questions about the remediation, report, and testing that we performed.</li></ul> |
| 6 | **Analyze** | Once the pentest is complete, analyze the security posture of your asset.<ul><li>Deep dive into the pentest report to assess discovered vulnerabilities with your development and security teams.</li><li>Take the required remediation actions.</li><li>Identify what you expect from your next pentest for this asset.</li></ul> |

## Asset Types

For advanced pentests run by the Cobalt Professional Services team, we support additional asset types, beyond our standard [asset types](/platform-deep-dive/assets/asset-types/). You may see these asset types in the Cobalt UI:

| Asset Type | Description |
|---|---|
| IoT | An IoT ecosystem. As [defined](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/iot_device) by NIST, an IoT device has at least one transducer (sensor or actuator) for interacting directly with the physical world and at least one network interface, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth, for interfacing with the digital world. |
| Physical | An office, building, campus, or a physical device. |
| Thick Client | An application installed locally on a user's computer. |
| Wireless Network | A network that allows devices to stay connected without using wires of any kind. |
| Other | Asset used in other advanced pentest engagements, such as phishing, read teaming, security hardening, and more.

## How to Launch a Pentest

A Specialized pentest that you see in the Cobalt UI is a pentest engagement conducted by the Cobalt Professional Services team.

![Specialized pentest in the Cobalt UI](/profservices/specialized-pentest-label.png "Specialized pentest in the Cobalt UI")

To launch an advanced pentest, **contact our Professional Services team** at [professional_services@cobalt.io](mailto:professional_services@cobalt.io). You can't create an advanced pentest or set up a special asset in the UI—we'll do that for you.

Once we've set up a Specialized pentest, you can:

- Edit [asset details](/getting-started/assets/#asset-details), except for the asset type.
- Edit pentest details. Some pentest parameters may slightly differ for advanced pentests.
