To set up a pentest, you need to define the location of your asset.
Since the pentests that we support are all "online," you would set a pentest target to
their location on the internet.

| Asset Type       | Typical Target                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Web              | Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) such as www.example.com. May also specify an IP or network address. |
| Mobile           | URL where anyone can download a mobile app, such as on Google Play or the Apple App Store.             |
| API              | Base URL of the API. You can define the endpoints / queries in the Instructions text box.              |
| External Network | IP addresses or the IP network address.                                                                |
| Internal Network | IP network address. External IP address for the [Jump Box](/getting-started/glossary/#jump-box).       |
| Cloud Config     | IP address(es) and FQDNs of your cloud components.                                                     |

After you've defined the target, proceed with the [Pentest Methodology](/methodologies/).
