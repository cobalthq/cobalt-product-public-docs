You can launch the following pentests on the Cobalt platform:
- **PtaaS pentests** with Cobalt pentesters. This includes **Agile** and **Comprehensive** pentests.
- **In-House pentests** with your team, without involving Cobalt pentesters. Learn more about the [Pentest Management Platform](/pmp/).

To run a Red Team or IoT pentest, navigate to the `Catalog` page in Cobalt. Select `Request` on the service you are interested in and our CSM team will reach out to discuss. We will ask you to fill out a scoping form which will speed up the process. 

Learn more about [Specialized Pentests](/getting-started/glossary/#specialized-pentest).
