## Plan and scope the pentest

To create a new pentest, first you should [create the asset](/assets/) you wish to test.

Now, you're ready to launch your new pentest.

1. On the Pentests page, select Create a Pentest.

2. A modal will ask you if you want to Start from Scratch or Copy from Previous Pentest.

   1. **Start from scratch:** select the asset you want to test

   2. **Copy from previous pentest:** select the pentest you wish to copy. This will copy most of the information except for information we need specific to each pentest e.g. credentials or point of contact

3. Select Confirm to start filling out the pentest
