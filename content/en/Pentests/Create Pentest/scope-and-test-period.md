  Identify the complexity and type of your asset, along with the intended start date for your pentest.
---

The complexity of your asset determines the number of credits required for a pentest. The bigger the pentest scope, the more credits you need.

Learn more about [Cobalt credits](/platform-deep-dive/credits/).

{{% alert title="Scope a Copied Pentest" color="primary" %}}
When you copy a pentest you will be able to copy the scope if the asset has not changed size. Select from the options:

1. **Use same scope as copied pentest (pre-filled below):** If the general size of the asset has not changed, inherit the scope of your last completed pentest.
2. **I need to redefine the scope:** If the general size of the asset has changed, rescope the pentest by adjusting scoping parameters, as described below.

Scoping aims to identify the complexity of your asset. Under Scoping, specify the number of parameters associated with the asset that need to be tested. To get exact numbers, consult with the asset owner inside your organization.

Scoping parameters differ for each [asset type](/assets/asset-types/):

- [Web](#web)
- [Mobile](#mobile)
- [API](#api)
- [External Network](#external-network)
- [Internal Network](#internal-network)
- [Cloud Network](#cloud-network)
- [Desktop](#desktop)
- [AI/LLM Pentest](#ai-llm-pentest)
- [Assets of multiple types](#assets-of-multiple-types)

Once you've scoped the pentest, review the required [credits](/platform-deep-dive/credits/), as determined by our calculator.

### **Web** {#web}

To scope a pentest for a Web asset, specify the number of the following characteristics of the asset that need to be tested.

| <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Parameter</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Definition</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Scoping Guidelines</span> |

| [User Roles](/getting-started/glossary/#user-role) | {{% user-role %}} | <p>Enter the number of User Roles in your Web asset that need to be tested.</p><p>{{% count-user-roles %}}</p> |
| [Dynamic Pages](/getting-started/glossary/#dynamic-web-page)/[Routes](/getting-started/glossary/#route-software) | <p>A [dynamic page](/getting-started/glossary/#dynamic-web-page) is a unique web page that facilitates user interaction, such as submitting data, entering parameters, or uploading content.<ul><li>Read-only [static pages](/getting-started/glossary/#static-web-page) are not counted because there is no interaction.</li><li>A product catalog is not measured because the page workflow is not unique.</li></ul></p><p>A Route is a system for resource navigation in [single-page applications (SPAs)](/getting-started/glossary/#single-page-application). In SPAs that use frameworks such as Angular, React, or Ember, routes provide unique URLs to specific content within the application.</p> | Determine the type of your Web asset:<br><ul><li>[Traditional web application](/getting-started/glossary/#traditional-web-application). Enter the number of [dynamic pages](/getting-started/glossary/#dynamic-web-page) based on unique page templates.<ul><li>As part of our tests for [dynamic pages](/getting-started/glossary/#dynamic-web-page), we also test the backend API endpoints frequently used to populate content on those pages.</li></ul></li><li>[Single-page application](/getting-started/glossary/#single-page-application). Enter the number of [routes](/getting-started/glossary/#route-software) to test.<ul><li>As an example, read the [React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/concepts) to learn more about routing.</li></ul></li></ul>Usually, an application includes one or more routing modules or files where you can retrieve the number of pages or routes using special commands or tools. |

If the only APIs in your assets populate web pages, you may not need to set up a separate API asset. We test such APIs as part of our tests of a Web asset.

### **Desktop** {#desktop}

To scope a pentest for a Desktop asset, specify the number of the following characteristics of the asset that need to be tested.

| <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Parameter</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Definition</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Scoping Guidelines</span> |

### **AI LLM Pentest** {#ai-llm-pentest}

To scope an AI/LLM pentest specify the Number of independent LLM features to be tested.

| <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Parameter</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Definition</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Scoping Guidelines</span> |
|---|---|---|
| LLM Features | <p>A specific capability or functionality exhibited by a Large Language Model (LLM). | <p>Enter the total number of LLM features within your application that need to be tested. Example of a feature include a chatbot.</li></ul> |

If multiple independent features are selected, the results will be documented in the same report and findings will reported in the same pentest. If separate reports are needed, it’s recommended to run seperate pentests for them.

AI/LLM pentests are available for Web assets only.

### **Assets of Multiple Types**

Sometimes, assets fit into more than one category. To that end, Cobalt supports pentests on assets in the following groups of categories:

- [Web](#web) + [API](#api)
- [Web](#web) + [API](#api) + [External Network](#external-network)
- [Web](#web) + [External Network](#external-network)
- [Web](#web) + [Mobile](#mobile)

To scope a pentest for a combined asset, specify the number of characteristics for each asset type that it includes. Refer to the corresponding sections of this guide for details.

#### **Set a Start Date**

Depending on your [PtaaS tier](https://www.cobalt.io/pentest-pricing), you can schedule pentests with a start date from at least one to three business days after submitting it for review. Pentests submitted after 11 AM PST (19:00 UTC) will require an additional business day start time.

Our staff will confirm the pentest end date after review. Pentest timelines depend on test focus, scope, and other factors. Retest end date shows when your free retesting period ends, this is based on your contract tier and end date.
