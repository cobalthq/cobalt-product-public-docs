  Identify the complexity and type of your asset, along with the intended start date for your pentest.
---

The complexity of your asset determines the number of credits required for a pentest. The bigger the pentest scope, the more credits you need.

Learn more about [Cobalt credits](/platform-deep-dive/credits/).

{{% alert title="Scope a Copied Pentest" color="primary" %}}
When you copy a pentest you will be able to copy the scope if the asset has not changed size. Select from the options:

1. **Use same scope as copied pentest (pre-filled below):** If the general size of the asset has not changed, inherit the scope of your last completed pentest.
2. **I need to redefine the scope:** If the general size of the asset has changed, rescope the pentest by adjusting scoping parameters, as described below.

Scoping aims to identify the complexity of your asset. Under Scoping, specify the number of parameters associated with the asset that need to be tested. To get exact numbers, consult with the asset owner inside your organization.

Scoping parameters differ for each [asset type](/assets/asset-types/):

- [Web](#web)
- [Mobile](#mobile)
- [API](#api)
- [External Network](#external-network)
- [Internal Network](#internal-network)
- [Cloud Config](#cloud-configuration-review)
- [Desktop](#desktop)
- [AI/LLM Pentest](#ai/llm-pentesting)
- [Assets of multiple types](#assets-of-multiple-types)

Once you've scoped the pentest, review the required [credits](/platform-deep-dive/credits/), as determined by our calculator.

### **Web** {#web}

To scope a pentest for a Web asset, specify the number of the following characteristics of the asset that need to be tested.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
If the only APIs in your assets populate web pages, you may not need to set up a separate API asset. We test such APIs as part of our tests of a Web asset.

To scope a cloud configuration review, specify the number of the following characteristics of the asset that need to be reviewed.

{{% image src="/pentest-workflow/cloud-config-scoping-parameters.png" alt="Showing scoping parameters for a Cloud Configuration asset" %}}

| <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Parameter</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Definition</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Scoping Guidelines</span> |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts, Projects, or Resource Groups | <p>[Accounts](/getting-started/glossary/##accounts-cloud-assets) refer to accounts in your AWS cloud asset.</p><p>[Projects](/getting-started/glossary/#projects-cloud-assets) are all resources included in your GCP cloud asset.</p><p>[Resource Groups](/getting-started/glossary/#resource-group-cloud) are sets of resources in an Azure cloud asset. | <p>Enter the total number of accounts, projects, or resource groups in your cloud asset that need to be reviewed.<ul><li>**AWS**: The number of AWS accounts within the AWS Organization. The IAM user that pentesters will use to enumerate and assess AWS configurations is set based upon these accounts.</li><li>**GCP**: The cloud configuration size is based on _Projects_. In Identity and Access Management (IAM), access is managed through IAM policies. An IAM policy can be attached to a Google Cloud Project. Each policy contains a collection of role bindings that associate one or more principals, such as users or service accounts, with an IAM role.</li><li>**Azure**: Subscriptions may contain various Resource Groups—containers that hold related resources for an Azure solution. The CIS Benchmark for Azure is assessed at the Subscription level.</li></ul> |
| Unique Service Instances | <p>Unique services are the different functionalities that you’ve configured in your cloud environment. | <p>Enter the number of unique services in your cloud asset that need to be reviewed.<ul><li>Examples of services: EC2, S3, Comprehend, Kubernetes, Azure Bot Service, Cloud Storage, Azure Container Service.</li><li>Cobalt sizes _Unique Instance of Services Used_ for Cloud Configuration Reviews as we’re enumerating configurations, not hosts. Example: 100 EC2 instances using the same base image are considered redundant from the configuration perspective and counted as 1 unique service.</li></ul> |

### **Desktop** {#desktop}

To scope a pentest for a Desktop asset, specify the number of the following characteristics of the asset that need to be tested.

| <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Parameter</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Definition</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Scoping Guidelines</span> |

Examples of desktop operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, various Linux distributions, and others.</li></ul> |

### **AI/LLM Pentesting**

To scope an AI/LLM pentest specify the Number of independent LLM features to be tested.

| <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Parameter</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Definition</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Scoping Guidelines</span> |
|---|---|---|
| LLM Features | <p>A specific capability or functionality exhibited by a Large Language Model (LLM). | <p>Enter the total number of LLM features within your application that need to be tested. Example of a feature include a chatbot.</li></ul> |

If multiple independent features are selected, the results will be documented in the same report and findings will reported in the same pentest. If separate reports are needed, it’s recommended to run seperate pentests for them.

AI/LLM pentests are available for Web assets only.

### **Assets of Multiple Types**

Sometimes, assets fit into more than one category. To that end, Cobalt supports pentests on assets in the following groups of categories:

- [Web](#web) + [API](#api)
- [Web](#web) + [API](#api) + [External Network](#external-network)
- [Web](#web) + [External Network](#external-network)
- [Web](#web) + [Mobile](#mobile)

To scope a pentest for a combined asset, specify the number of characteristics for each asset type that it includes. Refer to the corresponding sections of this guide for details.

#### **Set a Start Date**

Depending on your [PtaaS tier](https://www.cobalt.io/pentest-pricing), you can schedule pentests with a start date from at least one to three business days after submitting it for review. Pentests submitted after 11 AM PST (19:00 UTC) will require an additional business day start time.

Our staff will confirm the end date after review. Pentest timelines depend on test focus, scope, and other factors. Retest end date shows when your free retesting period ends, this is based on your tier and contract end date.
