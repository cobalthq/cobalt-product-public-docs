Our Preparation page details the steps you need to complete before the pentest, otherwise your start date could be impacted.

#### **1. Ensure testers have access**

1. Are the credentials valid?
2. Do you need to set up any access requirements?

#### **2. Add our IPs to your allowlist**

Our pentesters send requests from one or more IP addresses on a Virtual Private Network. Share this pentest with your network administrator. They may need to know the IP addresses that we use:

- 188.226.141.7
- 209.222.30.28
- 185.70.198.155
- 5.22.219.47

- 96.126.102.182
- 64.226.133.130

#### **3. Confirm the team availability**

The Point of Contact assigned is expected to collaborate with our Cobalt staff and pentesters to ensure we have enough information to start the pentest.
