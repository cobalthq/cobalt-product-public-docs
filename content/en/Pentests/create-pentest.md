## Plan and scope the pentest

To create a new pentest, first you should [create the asset](/assets/) you wish to test.

Now, you're ready to launch your new pentest.

1. On the Pentests page, select Create a Pentest.

2. A modal will ask you if you want to Start from Scratch or Copy from Previous Pentest.

   1. **Start from scratch:** select the asset you want to test

   2. **Copy from previous pentest:** select the pentest you wish to copy. This will copy most of the information except for information we need specific to each pentest e.g. credentials or point of contact

3. Select Confirm to start filling out the pentest

#### **4. Set your test [Methodology](/methodologies/).**

Pentesters follow specific methodologies for each test. If your environment includes multiple asset types that can't be effectively combined into a single test, we recommend creating separate tests.

## Asset Details {#asset-details}

Next you'll review your **Asset Details**. This page is used to review any general details about your asset, specific pentest details will be provided next. See the **[create asset](/assets/create-asset/)** page for details on what information to provide here.

## Pentest Details {#pentest-details}

On the **Pentest Details** page, we will ask you to provide requirements. All mandatory fields must be filled out prior to submitting the test for review.

#### **1. Set the Objectives**

Add reasons for wanting to conduct this pentest or any concerns that our team should be aware of for example:

- SOC 2 compliance audit testing
- Brand new software code introduced
- Multiple user roles need testing

#### **2. Set the In-Scope Targets**

Adjust the targets in scope if you want to focus the pentest on a specific part of the asset.

Typically, all you need is a URL, IP address, or link.

| Asset Type       | Typical Target                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web              | Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) such as [www.example.com](https://www.example.com/). May also specify an IP or network address. |
| Mobile           | URL where anyone can download a mobile app, such as on Google Play or the Apple App Store.                                         |
| API              | Base URL of the API. You can define the endpoints / queries in the Instructions text box.                                          |
| External Network | IP addresses or the IP network address.                                                                                            |
| Internal Network | IP network address. External IP address for the [Jump Box](/glossary/#jump-box).                                                   |
| Cloud Config     | IP address(es) and FQDNs of your cloud components.                                                                                 |

#### **3. Technology Stack**

Technologies that you selected on the asset details page populate in the Technology Stack field in the pentest workflow. You can add more technologies for your pentest, in addition to those that you specified for your asset earlier. For guidelines on our technology stack see **[create an asset](/assets/create-asset/)**.

#### **4. Credentials**

Provide credential instructions for testers to access the application or environment.

- Enter credentials in **Access Instructions** (Access Instructions is the next field on the brief)
- Send credentials to testers through encrypted email (You can find email addresses within the brief once your pentest is in the Planned state)
- Testers can create their own credentials
- Authentication is not required

![Credentials Section](/pentest-workflow/image3.png "Credentials section showing different authentication options")

#### **5. Access Instructions**

Provide Credentials and/or Access Instructions as required.

**Credentials** should be provided for each user role planned for your pentest, include the following:

- 1 test account per pentester
- A short description of the user role and associated permissions
- Authentication specification for the test account
- Ensure your passwords are secure
- Test your credentials to ensure that pentesters can access your software.
- Any other authentication requirements such as [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/glossary/#multi-factor-authentication).
- Once the pentest (and any retests) are complete, disable or delete the dedicated accounts.

**Access instructions** includes how to access the target environment (if any/needed, e.g. if it is an internal network test, you can give info on the jumpbox)

#### **6. Special Instructions/Requirements**

Our pentesters need to know about the environment that they're testing, as well as whether they can find production data on the test system.

We need to know the environment of the pentest asset. The standard options are:

- Production (for end users)
- Staging (proposed future production environment)
- Development (asset in work)

Our pentesters also need information on test data. If your apps contain:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Credit-card holder data (CHD)

Our pentesters take extra care to protect that information.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
All Cobalt pentesters have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
{{% /alert %}}

#### **7. Prioritization or Exclusions**

This question is optional but can provide helpful information for testers. While you're not required to include any such details, we encourage you to include concerns that affect your production systems.

Provide any instructions related to the pentest like:

- Key areas for focus
- Specific vulnerabilities of concern
- Features, systems, or tests that are out of scope
- Potential risks or sensitive areas

#### **8. Collaboration**

Our Cobalt team and pentesters will have updates and questions for you as your pentest progresses. Select your preferred communication channel:

- **Cobalt Slack:** A [Slack channel](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/collaborate-on-pentests/#use-slack-for-communication) dedicated for your pentest

- **Connect to Your Own Slack:** Select this to invite our pentesting team to a channel in your Slack environment.

- **Cobalt In-App Messaging:** Collaborate directly in the Cobalt platform with [messaging in the Cobalt app](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/collaborate-on-pentests/#collaborate-in-the-cobalt-app)

#### **9. Assign a Point of Contact**

Cobalt Staff may reach out to the point of contact with questions regarding the pentest.

- You can assign yourself as the point of contact.

- To assign other users, go to the Collaborators tab on the pentest page.

#### **10. Other Tester Requirements**

Optionally, you can specify special requirements for pentesters. For example, if industry, company, or national regulations require that you limit pentesters to residents of one or more countries, you can request this. If you select one of these options, be sure to include details in the field below.

We can't guarantee that we'll accept your additional request. This may also delay scheduling the pentest.

#### **11. Specifications**

Based on the methodology selected on the Overview page, you will be required to check which specifications apply to your asset. If the specification applies, please provide details in the text box provided.

By providing this, you'll ensure a more effective and targeted pentest.

## Scope & Test Period {#scope-test-period}

The complexity of your asset determines the number of credits required for a pentest. The bigger the pentest scope, the more credits you need.

Learn more about [Cobalt credits](/platform-deep-dive/credits/).

![Scope Copy Options](/pentest-workflow/image5.png "Options for copying scope from previous pentest")

Scoping aims to identify the complexity of your asset. Under Scoping, specify the number of parameters associated with the asset that need to be tested. To get exact numbers, consult with the asset owner inside your organization.

Scoping parameters differ for each [asset type](/assets/asset-types/). For detailed scoping guidelines for each asset type, see [planning and scoping](/pentests/planning/).

#### **Set a Start Date**

Depending on your [PtaaS tier](https://www.cobalt.io/pentest-pricing), you can schedule pentests with a start date from at least one to three business days after submitting it for review. Pentests submitted after 11 AM PST (19:00 UTC) will require an additional business day start time.

Our staff will confirm the end date after review. Pentest timelines depend on test focus, scope, and other factors. Retest end date shows when your free retesting period ends, this is based on your tier and contract end date.

## Preparation {#preparation}

Our Preparation page details steps you need to complete before the pentest, otherwise your start date could be impacted.

#### **1. Ensure testers have access**

1. Are the credentials valid?
2. Do you need to set up any access requirements?

#### **2. Add our IPs to your allowlist**

Our pentesters send requests from one or more IP addresses on a Virtual Private Network. Share this pentest with your network administrator. They may need to know the IP addresses that we use:

- 188.226.141.7
- 209.222.30.28
- 185.70.198.155
- 5.22.219.47
- 64.226.132.108
- 96.126.102.182
- 64.226.133.130
- 216.238.76.199
- 216.238.106.73
- 212.59.68.70
- 192.46.213.72
- 139.84.156.110
- 172.104.52.94
- 67.219.111.23
- 139.84.232.86

#### **3. Confirm the team availability**

The Point of Contact assigned is expected to collaborate with our Cobalt staff and pentesters to ensure we have enough information to start the pentest.
