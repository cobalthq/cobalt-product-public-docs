## Plan and scope the pentest

To create a new pentest, first you should [create the asset](/assets/) you wish to test.

Now, you're ready to launch your new pentest.

1. On the Pentests page, select Create a Pentest.

2. A modal will ask you if you want to Start from Scratch or Copy from Previous Pentest.

   1. **Start from scratch:** select the asset you want to test

   2. **Copy from previous pentest:** select the pentest you wish to copy. This will copy most of the information except for information we need specific to each pentest e.g. credentials or point of contact

3. Select Confirm to start filling out the pentest

## Overview {#overview}

You'll start on the **Overview** page. We'll use this information to create the right type of pentest for your needs.

{{% image src="/pentest-workflow/overview-page-configuration.png" alt="Overview page showing pentest configuration options" %}}

#### **1. Name the Pentest**

Change the default Title if you have specific naming conventions

Default title format: {Asset Name} {MM/YYYY}

#### **2. Set your Test Goals**

Help us understand your goals â€” whether it's meeting compliance, assessing security risks, or testing a recent update. Your answer ensures a more effective pentest.

#### **3. Set the Test Focus**

Determine the focus for your test based on your use case, reporting needs and target audience.

#### **4. Set your test [Methodology](/methodologies/)**

Pentesters follow specific methodologies for each test. If your environment includes multiple asset types that can't be effectively combined into a single test, we recommend creating separate tests.

## Asset Details {#asset-details}

Next you'll review your **Asset Details**. This page is used to review any general details about your asset, specific pentest details will be provided next. See the **[create asset](/assets/create-asset/)** page for details on what information to provide here.

## Pentest Details {#pentest-details}

On the **Pentest Details** page, we will ask you to provide requirements. All mandatory fields must be filled out prior to submitting the test for review.

#### **1. Set the Objectives**

Add reasons for wanting to conduct this pentest or any concerns that our team should be aware of for example:

- SOC 2 compliance audit testing
- Brand new software code introduced
- Multiple user roles need testing

#### **2. Set the In-Scope Targets**

Adjust the targets in scope if you want to focus the pentest on a specific part of the asset.

Typically, all you need is a URL, IP address, or link.

| Asset Type       | Typical Target                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web              | Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) such as [www.example.com](https://www.example.com/). May also specify an IP or network address. |
| Mobile           | URL where anyone can download a mobile app, such as on Google Play or the Apple App Store.                                         |
| API              | Base URL of the API. You can define the endpoints / queries in the Instructions text box.                                          |
| External Network | IP addresses or the IP network address.                                                                                            |
| Internal Network | IP network address. External IP address for the [Jump Box](/glossary/#jump-box).                                                   |
| Cloud Config     | IP address(es) and FQDNs of your cloud components.                                                                                 |

#### **3. Technology Stack**

Technologies that you selected on the asset details page populate in the Technology Stack field in the pentest workflow. You can add more technologies for your pentest, in addition to those that you specified for your asset earlier. For guidelines on our technology stack see **[create an asset](/assets/create-asset/)**.

#### **4. Credentials**

Provide credential instructions for testers to access the application or environment.

- Enter credentials in **Access Instructions** (Access Instructions is the next field on the brief)
- Send credentials to testers through encrypted email (You can find email addresses within the brief once your pentest is in the Planned state)
- Testers can create their own credentials
- Authentication is not required

{{% image src="/pentest-workflow/credentials-authentication-options.png" alt="Credentials section showing different authentication options" %}}

#### **5. Access Instructions**

Provide Credentials and/or Access Instructions as required.

**Credentials** should be provided for each user role planned for your pentest, include the following:

- 1 test account per pentester
- A short description of the user role and associated permissions
- Authentication specification for the test account
- Ensure your passwords are secure
- Test your credentials to ensure that pentesters can access your software.
- Any other authentication requirements such as [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/glossary/#multi-factor-authentication).
- Once the pentest (and any retests) are complete, disable or delete the dedicated accounts.

**Access instructions** includes how to access the target environment (if any/needed, e.g. if it is an internal network test, you can give info on the jumpbox)

#### **6. Special Instructions/Requirements**

Our pentesters need to know about the environment that they're testing, as well as whether they can find production data on the test system.

We need to know the environment of the pentest asset. The standard options are:

- Production (for end users)
- Staging (proposed future production environment)
- Development (asset in work)

Our pentesters also need information on test data. If your apps contain:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Credit-card holder data (CHD)

Our pentesters take extra care to protect that information.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
All Cobalt pentesters have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
{{% /alert %}}

#### **7. Prioritization or Exclusions**

This question is optional but can provide helpful information for testers. While you're not required to include any such details, we encourage you to include concerns that affect your production systems.

Provide any instructions related to the pentest like:

- Key areas for focus
- Specific vulnerabilities of concern
- Features, systems, or tests that are out of scope
- Potential risks or sensitive areas

#### **8. Collaboration**

Our Cobalt team and pentesters will have updates and questions for you as your pentest progresses. Select your preferred communication channel:

- **Cobalt Slack:** A [Slack channel](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/collaborate-on-pentests/#use-slack-for-communication) dedicated for your pentest

- **Connect to Your Own Slack:** Select this to invite our pentesting team to a channel in your Slack environment.

- **Cobalt In-App Messaging:** Collaborate directly in the Cobalt platform with [messaging in the Cobalt app](/platform-deep-dive/collaboration/collaborate-on-pentests/#collaborate-in-the-cobalt-app)

#### **9. Assign a Point of Contact**

Cobalt Staff may reach out to the point of contact with questions regarding the pentest.

- You can assign yourself as the point of contact.

- To assign other users, go to the Collaborators tab on the pentest page.

#### **10. Other Tester Requirements**

Optionally, you can specify special requirements for pentesters. For example, if industry, company, or national regulations require that you limit pentesters to residents of one or more countries, you can request this. If you select one of these options, be sure to include details in the field below.

We can't guarantee that we'll accept your additional request. This may also delay scheduling the pentest.

#### **11. Specifications**

Based on the methodology selected on the Overview page, you will be required to check which specifications apply to your asset. If the specification applies, please provide details in the text box provided.

By providing this, you'll ensure a more effective and targeted pentest.

## Scope & Test Period {#scope-test-period}

The complexity of your asset determines the number of credits required for a pentest. The bigger the pentest scope, the more credits you need.

Learn more about [Cobalt credits](/platform-deep-dive/credits/).

{{% alert title="Scope a Copied Pentest" color="primary" %}}
When you copy a pentest you will be able to copy the scope if the asset has not changed size. Select from the options:

1. **Use same scope as copied pentest (pre-filled below):** If the general size of the asset has not changed, inherit the scope of your last completed pentest.
2. **I need to redefine the scope:** If the general size of the asset has changed, rescope the pentest by adjusting scoping parameters, as described below.

{{% image src="/pentest-workflow/scope-copy-options.png" alt="Options for copying scope from previous pentest" %}}
{{% /alert %}}

Scoping aims to identify the complexity of your asset. Under Scoping, specify the number of parameters associated with the asset that need to be tested. To get exact numbers, consult with the asset owner inside your organization.

Scoping parameters differ for each [asset type](/assets/asset-types/):

- [Web](#web)
- [Mobile](#mobile)
- [API](#api)
- [External Network](#external-network)
- [Internal Network](#internal-network)
- [Cloud Config](#cloud-configuration-review)
- [Desktop](#desktop)
- [AI/LLM Pentest](#ai/llm-pentesting)
- [Assets of multiple types](#assets-of-multiple-types)

Once you've scoped the pentest, review the required [credits](/platform-deep-dive/credits/), as determined by our calculator.

### **Web** {#web}

To scope a pentest for a Web asset, specify the number of the following characteristics of the asset that need to be tested.

| <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Parameter</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Definition</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Scoping Guidelines</span> |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts, Projects, or Resource Groups | <p>[Accounts](/getting-started/glossary/##accounts-cloud-assets) refer to accounts in your AWS cloud asset.</p><p>[Projects](/getting-started/glossary/#projects-cloud-assets) are all resources included in your GCP cloud asset.</p><p>[Resource Groups](/getting-started/glossary/#resource-group-cloud) are sets of resources in an Azure cloud asset. | <p>Enter the total number of accounts, projects, or resource groups in your cloud asset that need to be reviewed.<ul><li>**AWS**: The number of AWS accounts within the AWS Organization. The IAM user that pentesters will use to enumerate and assess AWS configurations is set based upon these accounts.</li><li>**GCP**: The cloud configuration size is based on _Projects_. In Identity and Access Management (IAM), access is managed through IAM policies. An IAM policy can be attached to a Google Cloud Project. Each policy contains a collection of role bindings that associate one or more principals, such as users or service accounts, with an IAM role.</li><li>**Azure**: Subscriptions may contain various Resource Groupsâ€”containers that hold related resources for an Azure solution. The CIS Benchmark for Azure is assessed at the Subscription level.</li></ul> |
| Unique Service Instances | <p>Unique services are the different functionalities that youâ€™ve configured in your cloud environment. | <p>Enter the number of unique services in your cloud asset that need to be reviewed.<ul><li>Examples of services: EC2, S3, Comprehend, Kubernetes, Azure Bot Service, Cloud Storage, Azure Container Service.</li><li>Cobalt sizes _Unique Instance of Services Used_ for Cloud Configuration Reviews as weâ€™re enumerating configurations, not hosts. Example: 100 EC2 instances using the same base image are considered redundant from the configuration perspective and counted as 1 unique service.</li></ul> |

### **Desktop** {#desktop}

To scope a pentest for a Desktop asset, specify the number of the following characteristics of the asset that need to be tested.

| <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Parameter</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Definition</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Scoping Guidelines</span> |

| [Operating Systems](/getting-started/glossary/#mobile-screen) | <p>An operating system (OS) is software that allows desktop devices to run applications and programs. | <p>Enter the total number of operating systems in your desktop application that need to be tested. Examples of desktop operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, various Linux distributions, and others.</li></ul> |

### **AI/LLM Pentesting**

To scope an AI/LLM pentest specify the Number of independent LLM features to be tested.

| <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Parameter</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Definition</span> | <span style="background-color: #ECE6FA; padding: 2px;">Scoping Guidelines</span> |
|---|---|---|
| LLM Features | <p>A specific capability or functionality exhibited by a Large Language Model (LLM). | <p>Enter the total number of LLM features within your application that need to be tested. Example of a feature include a chatbot.</li></ul> |

If multiple independent features are selected, the results will be documented in the same report and findings will reported in the same pentest. If separate reports are needed, itâ€™s recommended to run seperate pentests for them.

AI/LLM pentests are available for Web assets only.

### **Assets of Multiple Types**

Sometimes, assets fit into more than one category. To that end, Cobalt supports pentests on assets in the following groups of categories:

- [Web](#web) /+ [API](#api)
- [Web](#web) /+ [API](#api) /+ [External Network](#external-network)
- [Web](#web) /+ [External Network](#external-network)
- [Web](#web) /+ [Mobile](#mobile)

To scope a pentest for a combined asset, specify the number of characteristics for each asset type that it includes. Refer to the corresponding sections of this guide for details.

#### **Set a Start Date**

Depending on your [PtaaS tier](https://www.cobalt.io/pentest-pricing), you can schedule pentests with a start date from at least one to three business days after submitting it for review. Pentests submitted after 11 AM PST (19:00 UTC) will require an additional business day start time.

Our staff will confirm the end date after review. Pentest timelines depend on test focus, scope, and other factors. Retest end date shows when your free retesting period ends, this is based on your tier and contract end date.

## Preparation {#preparation}

Our Preparation page details steps you need to complete before the pentest, otherwise your start date could be impacted.

#### **1. Ensure testers have access**

1. Are the credentials valid?
2. Do you need to set up any access requirements?

#### **2. Add our IPs to your allowlist**

Our pentesters send requests from one or more IP addresses on a Virtual Private Network. Share this pentest with your network administrator. They may need to know the IP addresses that we use:

- 188.226.141.7
- 209.222.30.28
- 185.70.198.155
- 5.22.219.47
- 64.226.132.108
