## Add Pentest Details

Provide the details required to scope and run your pentest:

- Target environment
- Authentication and test credentials
- Special instructions and constraints
- Network access details (e.g., allowlists, WAF)

### Environment

We need to know the environment of the pentest asset. The standard options are:

{{% environment %}}

![Target Environment](/gsg/TargetEnvironment.png "Describe the environment that you want tested.")

### Controls

Tell us about how you've regulated access to your systems (for example, WAF or IP allowlists). If you have rate controls, include specifics.

### Cloud Platform Components

If part of your asset resides in the cloud, you may not need a separate cloud asset test. If your asset includes cloud components, include platform and service details.

For guidance, see [Cloud Configuration Review Methodologies](/methodologies/cloud-configuration-review/).

### Additional Guidelines

You may have already addressed some of these in [Pentest Objectives](/pentests/pentest-process/) and [Special Instructions](/pentests/pentest-process/coverage-checklist/). You're welcome to provide more here.

### Test Data

If your apps contain sensitive data (PII, PHI, CHD), include details so our pentesters can ensure appropriate handling.

Once you've completed the details, continue with [planning and scoping](/pentests/pentest-process/coverage-checklist/).
