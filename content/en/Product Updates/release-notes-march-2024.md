### March 2024


#### Services Platform Page is Renamed to Catalog

To prepare for the impending launch of Engagements in April 2024, we have renamed the 'Services' page to 'Catalog'. The Catalog will serve as a centralized location housing our complete range of offensive security services. From this hub, customers will have the ability to create or request new offerings. Our aim is to make all of our services easy to access from one location, as our offerings continue to expand.

#### New Home Page Launches

We are excited to announce the launch of our new 'Home' page on the Cobalt platform. This centralized dashboard will serve as the welcome screen for our customers when they log in, providing them with a single-pane view of their testing activity. 

The purpose of this new feature is to help our customers visualize and prioritize what is most important to them, making it easier for them to stay informed and efficiently manage their testing activities. We believe that this new Home page will greatly improve the user experience and provide our customers with a powerful tool to optimize their offensive security program.

#### New Chart in Insights

Cobalt now offers a clear and simple overview of how customers manage their open findings over time with our new Severity Trend chart. This chart has been seamlessly integrated into our new Home page as well as Insights, ensuring that our customers have access to valuable insights and actionable data to support their offensive security program.
