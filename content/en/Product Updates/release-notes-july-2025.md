## Planning Page Download & Credit Bar Visualizations

You can now download a CSV of your tests within a specific contract period to easily share with external stakeholders. Additionally, we’ve updated the credit bar visualization on the planning page to help you better forecast your credit spend.

## Recurring Finding Improvements

To improve the workflow for carried-over findings, the system will now automatically transfer historical finding context (state, accepted risk reasons, and notes) to the new finding's activity feed. These new findings are also automatically labeled as “Carried Over” and “Previously Accepted Risk” label applied if applicable.

This saves significant manual effort and provides a complete audit trail for findings that carry over between tests, ensuring everyone has a clear understanding of an issue’s full lifecycle.
