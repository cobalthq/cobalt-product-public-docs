## Pentest Findings

We've redesigned the Pentest Findings interface to give your team greater clarity, efficiency, and full historical context as you manage your remediation workflow.

The Findings page now features a clean new design with two dedicated tabs:

- Current Pentest Findings
- Historical Findings

### Current Pentest Findings 

This is your new primary list, showing only the vulnerabilities discovered in the running pentest.

- Quick Filtering: Tiles at the top count findings by state, providing instant filtering.
- Sort, Export, Search: Use search, sort, and export tools to prioritize your remediation list.

### Historical Findings

This tab gives you full visibility into open findings from previous pentests on the same asset.

- Triage Transparency: Pentesters use this tab to verify if past issues are still reproducible. You gain a clear paper trail of this process, seeing which findings are Carried Over (unfixed) or marked Fixed.
- Accountability: This separation allows you to track tester decisions and provides full historical context for auditing and planning future remediation sprints.
