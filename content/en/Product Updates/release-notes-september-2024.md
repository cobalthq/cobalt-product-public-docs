#### Enhanced Downloaded PDF Report Styles

Similar to the Attestation letter, our other report types' (Full Report, Full Report with Finding Details, Customer Letter, Attestation Report) PDF downloads required a makeover to ensure a refined appearance and improved clarity.

#### Integration Builder Enhancements

##### Assistant

_Problem:_
The Integration Builder posed a learning curve for customers, requiring significant support before independent usage.

_Action:_
We’ve introduced an in-app assistant to guide customers in setting up new integrations and updating existing ones. Additionally, provided application-specific guides in product documentation to facilitate common integration implementations.

##### Notification Management

_Problem:_
Customers were not receiving notifications about integration errors, leading to delayed issue identification and resolution.

_Action:_
We’ve developed a notifications management interface within the Integration Builder, enabling users to set up notifications to any email address, including individuals, distribution lists, and monitoring systems.
