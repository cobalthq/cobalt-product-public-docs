### January 2024


#### Enhancements to Improve Transparency and Accountability in Carry Over Finding Process

To address issues with findings not being carried over from previous pentests, we have implemented the following improvements:

**Clarity in Carry Over Finding Process:**
- Added "this action cannot be undone" language in confirmation modals.
- Updated the blue banner to persist (not dismissable) to ensure all findings are addressed.

**"Not Applicable" Option:**
- Introduced an option to indicate that a finding was reviewed as part of the current test but was not applicable.
- Testers are required to provide reasons for marking a finding as "Not Applicable," enabling staff to provide additional context to customers if needed.
- These enhancements aim to enhance transparency and trust with our customers by ensuring that all findings from previous pentests are thoughtfully reviewed and addressed accordingly.
