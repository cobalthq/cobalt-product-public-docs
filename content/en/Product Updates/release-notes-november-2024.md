## Notification Preferences Enhanced for Pentests

Certain customers, particularly Org owners, were overwhelmed by excessive notifications in their Cobalt experience, as they were automatically included in all pentests and received all related notifications unnecessarily.

We've introduced the ability for users to customize their default notification preferences in their Profile settings at the top right corner. Users can now choose from the following options:

- Notifications on all activity
- Notifications on @mentions and findings they participate in
- Mute notifications, except on findings they follow

Customers can still adjust notification preferences for individual pentests without altering the default settings.
