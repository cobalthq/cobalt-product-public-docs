## New Sequence Recorder for DAST scanning

We are thrilled to introduce Cobalt’s Sequence Recorder, a powerful browser plugin designed to enhance the DAST scanning experience. This innovative tool records your browser actions, providing invaluable assistance in setting up an authenticated target. The recorded actions are subsequently utilized by the scans to authenticate to the target, offering a seamless and efficient process.

With this cutting-edge feature, we can now address a wider range of use cases for our customers who require multi-step login authentication. This enhancement reflects our commitment to providing comprehensive solutions that cater to the diverse needs of our valued users.

## Introducing the Age by Severity Chart

We are excited to unveil a significant update on our Home page and Insights page - the introduction of the ‘Age by Severity’ chart, which replaces the previous ‘Time to Fix’ chart. This new feature provides a fresh perspective by focusing on the age of Open Findings, urging customers to take proactive actions towards addressing security issues.

For instance, if a customer has 20 findings and has resolved two within two days, while the remaining eight findings remain unresolved after 90 days, the chart will display an average age of 90 days. This interactive visualization allows users to track the age of their open findings and align it with their set SLA, enhancing accountability and prioritization in the remediation process.

We believe that this new chart will empower our customers to make informed decisions and drive timely resolutions for their security vulnerabilities.
