## Digital Risk Assessment & Secure Code Review Reports

Previously, our Digital Risk Assessment (DRA) and Secure Code Review (SCR) report process involved manual steps, limiting our customers' ability to directly download the reports they required from the platform. We have enhanced our reporting system on the backend to seamlessly integrate DRA and SCR reports into the platform, enabling our customers to access and download the necessary reports promptly. 

With this improvement, any changes to findings data are instantly updated in the reports, ensuring that customers have up-to-date information available for download, thus offering a more cohesive and streamlined reporting experience.
