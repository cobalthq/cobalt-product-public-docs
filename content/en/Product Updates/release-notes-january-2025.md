## Partial Scans: Reduced Scope

Users can now quickly scan only specific parts of their applications and APIs, rather than waiting for a full scan, to focus on high-risk areas or new code changes.

- In the target settings: we added a new card for users to add + manage specific URLs to scan
- In the Scan Now modal: we added a section where users can additionally manage/override the added URLs

<strong>Key Benefits:</strong>

- Accelerates feedback cycles by enabling the scanning of only relevant code changes
- Minimizes scan durations by targeting specific sections of an application or API
- Prioritizes high-risk areas by focusing scans on critical or recently updated sections
- Reduces vulnerability noise, allowing users to concentrate on the most important security issues and potentially improving overall scanning efficiency.
