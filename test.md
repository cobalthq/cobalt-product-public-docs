Our customers need help securing their systems. As pentesters, you've seen what can go wrong. Many of you have written about what we can do to keep our systems more secure.

The Cobalt Product Documentation team, in cooperation with the PenOps team, wants your help. We're creating a book, "Best Practices for Security," focused on the OWASP 2021 Top 10. We'll start with a small group of contributors who've written about security.

We need contributors who can write for developer audiences.

Typical security documentation is dense. We want to do better! To maximize the impact of your contributions, we want to work with you to make your written work more 'readable'. Our goal is content at a Flesch-Kincaid reading level of US Grade 10 (or below). If your content already meets that requirement, fantastic!

To qualify, we'd like one or more writing samples. We'll evaluate them for content and readability. If your samples don't meet the noted Flesch-Kincaid goal, that's OK, we can work with you.

If you qualify, we'd ask you to create content for one of the topics in the OWASP Top 10:2021 list. If you're unsure about a topic, we can work with you to refine a proposal and even an outline.

We could accept the following types of articles:

- A general article based on the OWASP Top 10 item
- A more specific article based on a common vulnerability related to the item. For example, you might write about best practices for Attribute Based Access Control, as part of a chapter on A01:2021 - Broken Access Control.

We want you to incorporate your pentest experience. We'll help make sure that the article does not include any identifying information for individuals or customers.

We create our Product Documentation in a Git repository (built on Hugo). If we approve your application, you'll submit your contribution with a Pull Request (PR). Our Git repository includes the Vale grammar linter, customized for Cobalt styles. It also includes a Flesch-Kincaid plugin, which we use to measure readability. As our repository is public, you're welcome to use these tools before you submit your PR.

Our ideal candidate has: 

- Strong writing skills
- In-depth knowledge of security issues related to the OWASP 2021 Top 10
  - (something about early qualifiers and focus on OWASP items 1, 2, 3)
- The ability to write in Markdown (Goldmark)
- Basic knowledge of Git

This is a paid opportunity. If we accept and merge your PR, we'll pay you US $500 per article. We may have feedback on your PR, based on content and readability.

In addition, we'll:

- Publish your work (with author credit) with our product documentation.
- Support links from your work to your social media (LinkedIn/Twitter)

We are also treating this as a long-term project. We want to help developers do more to enhance security of all assets, so we want to work on content for topics beyond the OWASP 2021 Top 10.
