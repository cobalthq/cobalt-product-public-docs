## How Cobalt Core Pentesters Contribute to Cobalt Product Documentation

This guide describes how our [Cobalt Core Pentesters](https://cobalt.io/our-pentesters) create
content to help our customer developers promote best (security) practices on their systems.

We're starting a [Best Practices for Security](./content/en/BestPractices/_index.md) guide with
selected Cobalt Core pentesters who've demonstrated the ability to write content that's easier
to read than most security documentation. We work towards documentation that's readable by
people at US Grade Level 10, consistent with requirements set by the US Military (Mil Spec MIL-M-38784B-1).

We've set up a grammar linter known as [Vale](https://errata.ai/vale-server/), based on the
[Google Developer Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/), modified for Cobalt
requirements. For more information, see our description of our [English Grammar Linter](./GrammarLinter.md). It can help you meet the readability standard described in our
[FleschKincaid.yml](https://github.com/cobalthq/cobalt-product-public-docs/blob/main/styles/Readability/FleschKincaid.yml) file.

We release all documentation from this repository under the [Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. This includes our Product Documentation, as well
as articles from our Cobalt Core pentesters that have been merged into this repository.
